Q,A
"sos while $212,000 is not much to the owners of family fortunes and french villas, it is several years of wages for middle-class canadians. eos sos how can these liberals justify sticking hard-working taxpayers with a quarter million dollar bill for nothing more than some fancy photo images on a budget cover? eos","sos mr. speaker, to set the record straight, the conservatives spent twice as much every year they were in power. eos sos i rest my case. eos"
"sos that represents a down payment on a french villa or half of a mercedes roadster. eos sos how can the liberals justify sticking taxpayers with $400,000 for two years' worth of budget cover pages? eos","sos mr. speaker, i just want to remind everyone that the previous government spent millions on flashy television advertising to promote and brand itself. eos sos they spent twice as much as we have. eos"
"sos member for louis-hbert says that his government is working for the less fortunate. eos sos what does he have to say to them after spending $200,000 on a piece of a paper? eos","sos mr. speaker, i would simply say to them that the previous government spent $750million on promoting its brand when it was in power. eos sos we are taking a much more targeted approach, one that is very responsible with taxpayers dollars. eos"
"sos now her lawyers are going after crupi for the money, but that was money stolen from the mouths of children. eos sos what steps will she take to make it right for the children of kashechewan and right for the people of canada? eos","sos mr. speaker, it is completely unacceptable when public funds intended for indigenous peoples are misappropriated. eos sos the consulting group in question was involved in a third party agreement with health canada and the kashechewan health services board between 2010 and 2015. once the department was made aware of an rcmp investigation into the consulting group, it conducted an audit of its agreements with the company. eos"
sos how can we truly achieve reconciliation when mtis and non-status are being told by the liberals that they do not exist and that their suffering is not worthy of recognition and compensation? eos sos why were the mtis and non-status intentionally excluded? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the sixties scoop is a dark and painful chapter in canada's history. eos sos this agreement, in principle, represents the first step in resolving this issue. eos"
"sos it is plain to see that this government is all too willing to bow and scrape to the united states. eos sos will the prime minister confirm for our farmers that he plans to use them as a bargaining chip, despite claims that supply management is not on the table? eos","sos mr. speaker, we have always defended supply management. eos sos it is a system that works. eos"
sos the minister of foreign affairs had to contradict him to hush up the whole business. eos sos will the liberal government confirm for our farmers that the parliamentary secretary laid out the liberals' true position and that they are preparing to open up supply management to accommodate washington? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we on this side of the aisle are committed to protecting the supply management system. eos sos we agree with the idea that every person should be free to make their own decisions, but i believe everyone in this house supports supply management, except the conservative party. eos"
"sos protecting our agricultural sector should not be negotiable. eos sos how can canadian farmers trust the government to defend supply management in public in canada, when behind closed doors, in secret, in washington, it is something different? eos","sos mr. speaker, actually i was there and it was on a tv panel, and i did not say the words ascribed to me. eos sos i will make the point that we have always defended supply management. eos"
"sos coroners service announced last week that the province's death toll from suspected overdose now stood at 1,013, more than the entire number recorded during 2016. we know this is an urgent public health crisis. eos sos could the minister of health tell us what she is doing to address this deadly epidemic? eos","sos mr. speaker, i would like to thank my hon. eos sos colleague for his advocacy on this issue. eos"
"sos the automotive sector has stated that not only will this backfire, companies will simply pay the low 2.5% tariffs instead of ensuring the content is regionally sourced and jobs are secure. eos sos when will the liberal government present its plan to protect the future and health of canadian jobs and our auto sector? eos","sos mr. speaker, canada is the biggest market for the united states, bigger than china, japan, and the u.k. combined. eos sos we are negotiating with the most protectionist u.s. administration since the 1930s. eos"
"sos however, the minister did not listen to him either. eos sos does the minister only listen to the prime minister, the minister of finance, and lobbyists, or does she ever only listen to herself, in the end? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government is proud to have announced its vision for the future of creative industries. eos sos these industries provide quality employment to over 630,000 canadians. eos"
"sos [english] we must take full advantage of the changing global priorities and create jobs for the future now to ensure a strong foundation for the next generation of canadians. eos sos can the minister of innovation, science and economic development please explain to the house the steps the government is taking? eos","sos mr. speaker, as the member for sackville prestonchezzetcook well knows, part of our innovations skills plan was to introduce superclusters. eos sos this initiative was about growing the economy and creating jobs. eos"
"sos however, liberal mps voted to defeat a conservative amendment to bill c-46 to provide for a five-year mandatory sentence for impaired drivers who kill. eos sos was the minister insincere when she claimed that she supports mandatory sentences for serious offences or does the minister believe that impaired driving causing death is not a serious offence? eos","sos mr. speaker, as i said many times, the prime minister is asking to do a broad review of the criminal justice system. eos sos i am undertaking that in partnership with the provinces and territories. eos"
"sos now we have the small business tax reform. eos sos instead of holding a press conference to frantically announce that he is going to make an announcement, why does the minister not simply put off his reform and do something that makes sense? eos","sos mr. speaker, i think that we were quite clear during the election campaign on the fact that we wanted to bring more fairness to our tax system in areas where such fairness is lacking. eos sos that is why we made proposals and listened to the reactions of canadians across the country, and to our caucus as well, to be sure that we are getting this right. eos"
sos is the minister asleep at the switch? eos sos is he waiting for another tragedy before he changes the rules surrounding transportation safety? eos,"sos mr. speaker, as members know, rail safety is my top priority. eos sos of course our sympathy and thoughts are with the victims of the lac-mgantic tragedy. eos"
"sos when liberals have totally screwed up a small business tax plan, when they have attacked small businesses while ignoring their wealthy friends, when they are backed so deep into a corner they have nowhere else to go, then and only then will liberals honour their commitments to canadians. eos sos why is keeping a promise the liberal version of damage control? eos","sos mr. speaker, as we know, it is a great day for small business owners in canada. eos sos in august 2015, we promised in our platform, and let me quote it because these members may want to hear the answer: to reduce the small business tax rate to 9 percent from 11 percent . eos"
"sos while touring my riding, i heard concerns that this decision will only add another layer of bureaucracy and make it even more difficult to deliver on pressing issues like nunavut's suicide rate and the lack of mental health services. eos sos how will the split of the department help solve these and other issues that nunavummiut currently face? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government is committed to a renewed relationship with indigenous people. eos sos we have listened to arcap's recommendation to simultaneously improve the delivery of services while accelerating a move to self-determination for indigenous people. eos"
"sos [english] the discussion on tax reform created many concerns for small business owners throughout the country, including myself. eos sos could the parliamentary secretary to the minister of finance update the house on what we are doing as a government to support small businesses to grow our economy? eos","sos mr. speaker, i want to thank the hon. eos sos member for his tireless work on behalf of small businesses and his very constructive feedback with these proposals. eos"
sos his own minister avoided paying taxes in canada. eos sos when will the liberals come clean with canadians? eos,"sos mr. speaker, everyone works with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner to ensure full compliance with all her recommendations and legislation with respect to conflicts of interest. eos sos the minister of finance has full confidence in the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner and her recommendations. eos"
"sos however, he sees no problem with his right-hand man, the minister of finance, stashing money overseas in a private company for the past two years. eos sos why do the prime minister and his minister think they are above the law? eos","sos mr. speaker, as minister of small business and tourism, i am very proud of the announcements we are making. eos sos the changes we are making reflect what we have heard from canadians. eos"
sos the question is simple. eos sos when did the finance minister sell his shares in morneau shepell? eos,"sos mr. speaker, since taking office, the minister of finance has worked with the ethics commissioner to ensure that her every recommendation and all conflict of interest rules were followed. eos sos as the minister of small business and tourism, i am very pleased with the announcement we made yesterday. eos"
"sos we know the finance minister chose not to place his morneau shepell shares into a blind trust, so again, this question is very simple. eos sos when did the finance minister sell his shares in morneau shepell? eos","sos mr. speaker, the minister of finance, as i am sure all members do, works closely with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner to ensure that the rules are followed. eos sos all recommendations that were made to him, he accepted. eos"
sos the hon. eos sos leader of the opposition. eos,"sos mr. speaker, the one thing we can always count on with the liberals is that eventually they start acting like liberals. eos sos the minister has travelled the country for months calling pizza shop owners and farmers tax cheats, accusing all kinds of hard-working canadians of trying to avoid paying their fair share. eos"
sos we want to ensure that intergenerational transfers of businesses continue. eos sos we will support-- eos,sos the hon. eos sos member for rimouski-neigettetmiscouatales basques. eos
sos my question is simple. eos sos why did he not do so? eos,"sos mr.speaker, as i said, since he took the position, the minister of finance has been working with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner to make sure that all her recommendations and the legislation on conflicts of interest are followed to the letter. eos sos the minister of finance has full confidence in the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner and her recommendations. eos"
sos i know my definition of conflict of interest . eos sos i would like the minister to share his definition. eos,"sos mr. speaker, this is small business week in canada, and as the minister of small business and tourism, i would like to congratulate them for the work they do. eos sos the changes we are making are a direct response to what we have heard from canadians. eos"
"sos this is about a serious breach and potential conflict of interest. eos sos will my friend the parliamentary secretary to the minister of families, children and social development stand in the house and explain when he was told this untruth and who told it to him? eos","sos mr. speaker, as the minister of finance has said on many occasions, he is working with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner. eos sos he will continue to do this important work. eos"
"sos he has not divested nor placed his millions of shares in a blind trust. eos sos what is worse: this massive, troubling conflict of interest, or the fact that liberals do not seem to think there is a problem in the first place? eos","sos mr. speaker, as minister of small business and tourism, i will say that i am very proud that this government is actually listening and engaging with our job creators to ensure that the tax system works for them. eos sos the minister has full confidence in the ethics commissioner and her recommendations and is willing to take any further steps to avoid conflicts, or any perception of conflicts, as deemed appropriate by the ethics commissioner. eos"
sos we cannot believe the minister of finance. eos sos when did he sell his shares? eos,"sos mr.speaker, i want to reassure the house. eos sos the minister of finance has always been very transparent with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner, and he has always worked proactively with her to ensure that all the rules in place and her recommendations are followed. eos"
sos we also know that morneau shepell has holdings in the tax haven of barbados. eos sos when did the minister sell his shares in morneau shepell? eos,"sos mr.speaker, as i mentioned, the minister of finance has always worked in collaboration with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner in an entirely transparent manner to ensure that he is in compliance with the rules that govern all of us in the house. eos sos we have confidence in the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner, and the minister has even written the commissioner seeking another meeting to discuss his assets and to follow every instruction she might have regarding his personal assets. eos"
"sos the daily revelations of the finance minister show nothing but hypocrisy, and i want to know one simple thing. eos sos when did the finance minister sell his shares in morneau shepell? eos","sos mr. speaker, as i said, the minister of finance has been working with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner from the very beginning of his term to ensure that she had a full picture of his assets and that he would be in compliance with all rules governing us here in the house. eos sos he is also committed to acting on any and all recommendations she might make following a request that he initiated to meet with her. eos"
"sos this was his choice, always his choice, and these are his ethics we are talking about. eos sos i just want to know, when did the finance minister sell his shares in morneau shepell? eos","sos mr. speaker, the house has full confidence in the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner, and the minister of finance is committed to working with her. eos sos he requested a meeting with her in order to make sure he was following any recommendations she might make to him. eos"
sos it is a perfect example of a conflict of interest right out of the gate. eos sos the question is clear: when did the minister of finance sell his shares in morneau shepell? eos,"sos mr. speaker, from day one, the minister of finance has met with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner and worked with her to ensure that he followed all of her recommendations and that he was in compliance with the rules that govern us all. eos sos he is committed to doing the same moving forward, again in close collaboration with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner, who has the full confidence of the house. eos"
"sos seriously, the situation is completely untenable; we are talking about the moral authority of the minister of finance of canada, here. eos sos when did the minister of finance sell his shares in morneau shepell? eos","sos mr. speaker, as i said, the minister of finance has worked with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner since he first took office. eos sos this has been ongoing and he asked for a meeting with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner to ensure that he was in full compliance at all times. eos"
"sos for us, however, the protection of our supply management system is non-negotiable, and we will not allow it to be chipped away any further. eos sos to avoid repeating the same errors that were made with ceta and the trans-pacific partnership 11, can the minister confirm today that the liberals will not allow the agreement to be chipped away any further? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government strongly supports canada's supply management system and canadian families and producers. eos sos our government remains committed to listening to what canadians have to say about international trade. eos"
"sos both the liberals and the conservatives have no problem putting our supply managed sector up for grabs in trade deals like tpp and ceta, but this time, the liberals must protect our industry and say  no. eos sos will the minister drop the spin and finally tell the u.s. that supply management is not on the table? eos","sos mr. speaker, we are the party that implemented supply management, and we are going to continue to defend it. eos sos dairy trade between canada and the united states massively favours the u.s., by a ratio of five to one. eos"
"sos it must be because he sold the shares, otherwise he broke the law. eos sos therefore, when did the finance minister sell his shares in morneau shepell? eos","sos mr.speaker, as i mentioned, since the start of his term, the minister of finance has been working with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner to ensure that he is in full compliance with all the rules that govern us and that he follows any recommendation that she may make. eos sos just today, the minister wrote to the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner seeking a meeting. eos"
sos now he will not come clean with canadians about his business interest that put him into this conflict of interest. eos sos when will the minister finally come clean with canadians and tell them whether he still owns shares of morneau shepell? eos,"sos mr.speaker, since the start of his mandate, the minister of finance has always been open and transparent with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner. eos sos he is committed to continuing on that path, and to taking any steps she may recommend to make sure that he is in full conformity with the rules that govern members of parliament, parliamentary secretaries, and ministers in the house. eos"
"sos does the minister still own shares in his company? eos sos if so, when will he sell them? eos","sos mr. speaker, as i said, the minister of finance will continue to work with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner to comply with the rules that govern us. eos sos the member wants to know who the minister of finance is working for. eos"
sos let him answer the question. eos sos when did he sell his shares in morneau shepell? eos,"sos mr. speaker, let me set the record straight for my colleague. eos sos the minister of finance wrote to the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner today seeking a meeting. eos"
"sos this is a common-sense proposal, sound public policy that will help millions and save billions. eos sos will the liberals join us and support pharmacare for all canadians? eos","sos mr. speaker, canadians pay too much for prescription drugs. eos sos our government is taking bold action now to bring down the prices, while we also explore the need for a national formulary. eos"
sos what is the government waiting for? eos sos when will it declare the opioid crisis a canada-wide emergency? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we are in a national public health crisis in canada and we are responding in a way that is comprehensive, collaborative, compassionate, and also evidence based. eos sos we recently announced an investment of $7.5 million that will enhance the development of evidence-based practices that could be used by those dealing with this crisis on the ground. eos"
"sos given the recent poverty reduction conference and the unprecedented investments over the past two budgets, we know that fighting poverty and meeting canada's housing challenges are at the forefront of this government's agenda. eos sos could the minister of families, children and social development tell the house what he is doing on those important issues? eos","sos mr. speaker, i would like to congratulate my colleague from vancouver centre for being such a strong advocate of a more inclusive and more fair society. eos sos our government believes that housing is the cornerstone of the lives of families and communities. eos"
"sos although the minister of foreign affairs tried in vain to put the toothpaste back in the tube, her parliamentary secretary was very clear. eos sos when it comes to supply management, there is room for negotiation with the u.s. why is the liberal government ready to negotiate and thereby jeopardize the future of dairy, egg, and poultry farmers? eos","sos mr.speaker, our government is fully in favour of supply management and it will continue to defend it. eos sos as i said earlier, dairy trade between canada and the u.s. massively favours the u.s., by a ratio of five to one. eos"
"sos [translation]
              of course. eos sos when will the government stop the doublespeak and abandon its plan to open supply management to negotiations with washintgon? eos","sos mr.speaker, as i said, our government strongly supports supply management, farmers and their families. eos sos as we have said from the very start in the house, we will continue to defend producers from the americans. eos"
sos can canadian farmers trust the liberals to preserve the family farm? eos sos does the government have a plan to protect canadians' way of life? eos,"sos mr. speaker, canada is the biggest market to the united states, bigger than china, japan, and u.k. combined. eos sos as members know, we are dealing with the most protectionist u.s. government since the 1930s. eos"
"sos under conservative governments, the americans respected our system of supply management, but the liberal government is literally ready to sell the farm. eos sos when will that member and the government stop saying one thing to canadian farmers and another thing to their friends in washington? eos","sos mr. speaker, we on this side of the house, and those who are fortunate enough to be on our portion of the other side, believe in supply management. eos sos indeed, everyone in this house, with the exception of certain members of the progressive conservative party of canada, believe in supply management. eos"
"sos therefore, my question for the minister is simple. eos sos we know you do not have a plan to fix phoenix, but when will you have a plan to have a plan? eos","sos order, please. eos sos i will have to remind the hon. eos"
"sos some hon. eos sos members: oh, oh! eos","sos order, please. eos sos i am having trouble hearing what people are saying, and i have to hear them so we know if there is someone breaking any rules. eos"
sos i will ask the question one more time. eos sos does anyone know how long workers will have to wait for this disaster to be behind us? eos,"sos mr. speaker, it is unacceptable that public servants are not getting the salary they are owed. eos sos we are taking substantive measures to resolve this problem, including a $140-million investment in recruiting, hiring, and training new employees, emergency pay advances, and opening up satellite offices, among other things. eos"
"sos therefore, my question is very simple. eos sos will the government immediately take action to recover the millions of dollars that should have been given to canadian taxpayers? eos","sos mr. speaker, with respect to the joint venture, the repayment terms have not changed. eos sos what i do not understand is what the member opposite and the official opposition have against the aerospace sector. eos"
sos when will taxpayers be reimbursed for the money that was given to a canadian company to develop expertise here in canada? eos sos when will canadians be reimbursed? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government supports the aerospace sector and we will continue to work hard for the aerospace sector. eos sos [english] let me be very clear. eos"
sos it is canadian taxpayers. eos sos can the minister guarantee canadian taxpayers will be fully repaid by bombardier before this transaction is approved? eos,"sos mr. speaker, again, i do not know why the members opposite continue to undermine our aerospace sector. eos sos this is an anchor company that has made a world-class plane. eos"
"sos recently, the minister of canadian heritage unveiled her vision for creative canada, which calls for a major investment to help our creators through the canada media fund. eos sos can the minister give us more details about her vision for this major investment? eos","sos mr.speaker, i would like to thank my colleague from dorvallachinelasalle for her question and for her excellent work. eos sos as part of creative canada, the government will, starting in 2018, increase its contribution to the canada media fund in order to provide it with stable funding. eos"
"sos this will not hurt those among us who own french villas, but it will mean higher taxes for those who are hard-working canadians, such as single moms, first-time employees, new canadians, and young workers. eos sos will the minister finally table in this house the instructions that she sent to her officials, or is this just simply another broken liberal promise? eos","sos mr.speaker, since the start of our mandate, the government has been focused on helping the middle class. eos sos the documents in question did not reflect our government's intentions. eos"
"sos forty-five families could lose their homes when the federal government pulls funding from co-operative housing next year. eos sos given the looming expiry of co-operative operating agreements across canada, will the government agree to make this funding permanent and protect the housing for low- and middle-income residents? eos","sos mr. speaker, i congratulate the member for his question, which is exactly what we want to hear: the kind of housing support that the federal government needs to provide to all sorts of housing providers, including co-operatives and not-for-profit housing providers. eos sos i had the privilege of meeting many of them this morning. eos"
"sos we know that there are historical and systemic issues that have combined to cause this problem, and that is why the government has been focusing on bringing about socio-economic change in collaboration with indigenous communities. eos sos will the minister of public safety tell us what he is doing to ensure that indigenous people involved in the criminal justice system will receive the support they need to rehabilitate and heal, which ultimately makes canadian communities safer? eos","sos mr. speaker, i want to thank the member for northwest territories for his work. eos sos the overrepresentation of indigenous people in our criminal justice system is an intolerable situation, and we are working very hard to address it. eos"
"sos mr. khan cannot ask the prime minister that question directly, so i will. eos sos why did the prime minister not speak about the rohingya during his un general assembly speech? eos","sos mr. speaker, everybody in this government is seized with the issue of the rohingya. eos sos we know that the responsibility for ending the persecution of the rohingya falls squarely upon the commander-in-chief, the military leadership in myanmar, and aung san suu kyi. eos"
sos let me say it in a way that everyone will understand: no way. eos sos will the government stand up and refuse to abandon our farmers by immediately walking away from the negotiating table any time supply management is mentioned? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government strongly supports supply management, farmers, and their families. eos sos our government remains committed to listening to canadians on international trade issues. eos"
sos what is the minister waiting for to take action? eos sos how many shattered lives does he need to justify taking action? eos,"sos mr. speaker, as the member opposite knows, these types of particular instances that occur with job losses sometimes go before the courts under the ccaa, but more importantly, our government understands that we need to be there to help these citizens during these difficult times, help these workers, help the families, and help these different communities. eos sos we will remain engaged. eos"
"sos last night we learned that the minister of finance retained direct control over all of his personal holdings, including shares in his billion-dollar family business. eos sos when did the prime minister become aware that his finance minister was still controlling tens of millions of dollars' worth of investments from his personal fortune? eos","sos mr. speaker, when the minister of finance was first elected almost two years ago, he consulted the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner and followed all of her advice. eos sos that is the kind of thing that the members of this house and all canadians expect. eos"
"sos his shares in morneau shepell, which were worth $30 million two years ago, are now worth $40million. eos sos when did the prime minister become aware that his finance minister was still controlling tens of millions of dollars' worth of investments from his personal fortune? eos","sos mr. speaker, as i said, the minister of finance worked with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner from the start to make sure everything was up to date, to work with her, and to follow her advice in order to fulfill his ministerial mandate with integrity. eos sos he followed her advice and he remains open to doing so. eos"
"sos it was the prime minister, in his mandate letter to the finance minister. eos sos once again, when did the prime minister become aware of the finance minister's conflict of interest? eos","sos mr. speaker, when the finance minister first got elected two years ago, he approached the ethics commissioner, as many of us did, to talk about his situation and to ask her advice on how he could ensure that all the rules and all the principles were followed. eos sos he followed all of her advice, and indeed, has recently asked her if there is more he can do to go above and beyond what she originally asked of him. eos"
"sos all the while, if the prime minister truly wanted to find a wealthy canadian who was using the system to avoid paying higher taxes, all he had to do was turn slightly to the right, where he would find the finance minister, who is doing exactly that. eos sos so when did the prime minister become aware that the finance minister continued to control his personal fortune? eos","sos mr. speaker, over the course of the summer, we heard from canadians, small businesses, and middle-class canadians who are looking forward to making sure that the system is fair. eos sos that is exactly what
              
                some hon. eos"
sos the right hon. eos sos prime minister. eos,"sos mr. speaker, in the election campaign, we committed to supporting the middle class and those working hard to join it and to lower small business taxes to 9%. eos sos that is exactly what we have done. eos"
"sos that business will directly profit off target benefit pensions, which the liberals are introducing in bill c-27. eos sos therefore, can the prime minister confirm that his finance minister recused himself from any and all discussions on that bill? eos","sos mr. speaker, in the 2015 election campaign, we promised that as we reduce the small business tax rate to 9% from 11%, we will ensure that canadian-controlled private corporations are not used to reduce personal income tax obligations for high-income earners rather than supporting small businesses. eos sos that is a promise we made in that election campaign. eos"
"sos the one where, instead of owning shares in his own name, he can have them held by a company of which he is the sole shareholder. eos sos does the prime minister think it acceptable for the finance minister to be doing indirectly what he cannot do directly? eos","sos mr. speaker, despite what the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner might have said in 2014, the finance minister consulted with her in 2015 to ask her advice on what he should do to ensure he follows all the rules in place that govern us all. eos sos he followed her recommendations, and, as he said, he is always open to doing more, if she advises him to do more, to go above and beyond what she initially asked of him. eos"
sos i know my definition of conflict of interest . eos sos perhaps the prime minister would like to share his? eos,"sos mr. speaker, here in parliament, we have a conflict of interest and ethics commissioner who helps us make sure we are in compliance with conflict of interest and ethics rules. eos sos the minister of finance began working with the commissioner in 2015 to ensure he was fully compliant, and he is still working with her. eos"
"sos the finance minister does. eos sos what happens when you add one-third and two-thirds, other than a finance minister in a whole mess of trouble? eos","sos mr. speaker, i think the member opposite needs to take a sharp look at who he is throwing under the bus. eos sos the finance minister worked with the conflict of ethics commissioner, followed her recommendations and advice, and has continued to. eos"
sos the right hon. eos sos prime minister has the floor. eos,"sos mr. speaker, in this place, we have a conflict of ethics and interest commissioner, in whom we have confidence. eos sos we expect that when she gives advice to do something or behave in a certain way, we follow that. eos"
"sos this is a clear question to the prime minister. eos sos did he know, and if he did know, what did he do about it, or does he even care? eos","sos mr. speaker, i and everyone in this house, expect all members of this house to work with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner to follow the advice that she gives. eos sos that is what we do in this house, and that is one of the ways we go above the partisan politics and personal attacks to have confidence in the work that each and every one of us does in this house. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, here are the facts: the prime minister hid the details of his vacation on a private island from the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner, and now we see that the minister of finance did the same thing for two years by concealing the existence of his villa in france and refusing to place his assets in a blind trust. eos sos when did the prime minister learn that his finance minister holds assets in his company, which is managed by the department of finance and which still he fully controls? eos","sos mr. speaker, i have already answered that question. eos sos as everyone knows, the minister of finance worked with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner to ensure full compliance on everything having to do with his personal assets. eos"
sos i have a simple question for the prime minister. eos sos is it too much to ask for him to get his minister of finance to disclose all his assets to the canadian public? eos,"sos mr. speaker, on the contrary. eos sos those mechanics, small business owners, farmers, and fishers will all benefit from a tax cut thanks to the actions of this government. eos"
sos i want to know one specific thing. eos sos when did the prime minister learn that the minister of finance did not dispose of his shares in accordance with the ethics commissioner? eos,"sos mr. speaker, as is the case for all our ministers, i knew that our ministers, each and every one of them, have worked with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner to ensure that her advice is followed in their personal affairs. eos sos this is something that matters to all parliamentarians. eos"
"sos it is a personal matter; it is not his to look after. eos sos it absolutely is, and shame on the prime minister for not having the decency of ensuring that his finance minister is following the law. eos","sos mr. speaker, my responsibility is to ensure that this government stays focused on the things that matter and that we follow all the rules. eos sos that is why the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner gave clear advice to the minister of finance, which he followed and which he will continue to follow. eos"
sos is that where the prime minister stands today on his finance minister using loopholes to cover up and protect his assets? eos sos is that what we are hearing? eos,"sos mr. speaker, apparently unlike the members opposite, i still have confidence in the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner. eos sos she gave clear advice to the minister of finance. eos"
sos we are going to give the prime minister another chance. eos sos does he defend the behaviour of the minister of finance making money off of assets that he owns while enacting legislation as minister of finance? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i am glad that we can talk about the behaviour of the finance minister. eos sos the finance minister lowered taxes for the middle class and raised them on the wealthiest 1%. eos"

"sos mr. speaker, yesterday, the minister of finance stood in the house and claimed that an early administrative error was the reason he failed to disclose his offshore corporation to the ethics commissioner. eos sos could the minister confirm that if any canadian fails to disclose foreign companies to the appropriate government body, they can make the problem disappear simply by claiming it was an early administrative error, or does this only work if one is the prime minister's right-hand man? eos","sos mr. speaker, the finance minister has worked from the beginning, right after the election, with the ethics commissioner to make sure that he is in full compliance with the rules governing us in this house and to make sure he follows all of the recommendations she puts forward. eos sos he has done so, namely, he has put up a conflict of interest wall, which she recommended. eos"
sos he hid this from canadians until he got caught. eos sos how can we trust anything the minister says now that we know he has been deceiving canadians for so long? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we have all the trust in the ethics commissioner to set the right path forward for parliamentarians and to provide good recommendations. eos sos this minister has worked with the ethics commissioner from the very beginning to make sure he is in full compliance with the rules and that he follows her recommendations, which he has done. eos"
sos my question is for the minister of veterans affairs. eos sos will he join me and my colleague from durham and others from this house to walk 300 feet away to meet with the desmond family? eos,"sos mr. speaker, certainly i give my condolences to the families involved. eos sos we cannot talk of specific cases out of respect for the privacy of the veteran and of the families involved, but there is no question that one suicide is one too many. eos"
sos the conservatives did away with pilot projects. eos sos will the liberal government reinstate pilot projects to extend benefits for quebec's seasonal workers? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i thank my colleague for his excellent question. eos sos we believe it is important to have an employment insurance system that provides income security to families, many of whom live in very difficult conditions, and that helps people transition to new jobs. eos"
"sos the phoenix fiasco has been dragging on for almost two years, and still there is no end in sight. eos sos what is the government's plan to ensure that workers get the pay they so desperately need, and when will the phoenix backlog finally be cleared? eos","sos mr. speaker, it is unacceptable that hard-working public servants are not being paid the money they are owed. eos sos these issues have caused real hardships for many public servants and their families, and they should not have to face them. eos"
"sos diabetes sufferers have been eligible for the disability tax credit for over a decade, but now the government is stripping it away and raising taxes by over $1,000 on these vulnerable canadians. eos sos why did the finance minister use a loophole to make $65,000 a month from a company he regulates while targeting vulnerable disabled canadians with a tax increase? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government is committed to ensuring that all canadians have access to the credits and benefits to which they are entitled. eos sos i understand the concern of the diabetes groups. eos"
sos he used public powers for his private profit. eos sos did the finance minister have the permission of the ethics commissioner to introduce a law that would profit his own company? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i know the members opposite are going to continue to focus on my personal finances. eos sos i am going to continue to focus on the finances of canadians and of canadian families. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, the reality is that the minister keeps blaming the ethics commissioner for his own actions but, wait, the minister committed to that same commissioner, in writing, to abstain from matters related to morneau shepell. eos sos again, did the finance minister get written permission to introduce bill c-27, a bill that profited him and his family business? eos","sos mr. speaker, again, while others might want to focus on something different, i want to focus on canadians. eos sos since the question is directly related to pensions and canadians' success in retirement, what i would like to talk about is how well we have done helping canadians to retire. eos"
sos why does the minister support this double standard? eos sos why is he going after people who have diabetes? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government is committed to ensuring that all canadians have access to the credits and benefits to which they are entitled. eos sos i fully understand the concerns of people with diabetes and their families. eos"
sos it is a direct conflict of interest and we saw that with billc-27. eos sos my question is quite simple: when did the minister of finance get permission from the ethics commissioner to introduce billc-27? eos,"sos mr. speaker, while the opposition concerns itself with my personal finances, i am concerning myself with the financial situation of canadians and canadian families. eos sos that is what is important. eos"
"sos i can understand him wanting to move on to other things, but this government promised canadians higher ethical standards. eos sos my question is simple: what has become of those higher ethical standards? eos","sos mr. speaker, canadian families are a top priority for us, and it is our job to make life better for them. eos sos fortunately, things are better because of our policies. eos"
"sos most importantly, canadians believed it. eos sos what is it going to take for the finance minister to finally admit that he did something wrong? eos","sos mr. speaker, all of us on this side of the house are living up to the highest standards of integrity asked of us by the prime minister. eos sos i will continue to do so. eos"
sos he did not put his assets in a blind trust. eos sos was he so blind that he could not see the conflict of interest of his own conduct? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i appreciate the member opposite talking about the financial statement that we are going to give to canadians tomorrow. eos sos it is important for us to report on the kind of progress that we have made. eos"
"sos he introduced a bill that could benefit his company, and therefore himself. eos sos the question is very simple: how much money has he made from morneau shepell since he became minister of finance? eos","sos mr. speaker, i know that the opposition wants to talk about my finances. eos sos i want to talk about canadians' finances. eos"
sos that is an obvious conflict. eos sos did the finance minister recuse himself from all discussions about bill c-27? eos,"sos mr. speaker, while the opposition obsesses about my personal finances, i am going to continue to focus on what is going on for canadians. eos sos that is what we really care about. eos"
"sos for the last two years, he introduced and crafted legislation that directly benefits himself and his billion-dollar family company. eos sos why did the finance minister not recuse himself from all discussions about bill c-27? eos","sos mr. speaker, i know the members opposite will look for specific examples about me, but maybe i can provide some examples for canadians: the example of old age security, making sure that people can get their old age security at age 65; the example of the guaranteed income supplement, which we are increasing so canadian seniors can be in a better situation; or, enhancing the canada pension plan so that canadians in the future will have a better retirement. eos sos these are the sorts of retirement actions we are taking to make sure that canadians can do well today and tomorrow, and that they will have a dignified retirement. eos"
sos he put himself in a direct conflict of interest. eos sos my question to the minister of finance is simple: did he reach out to the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner to ensure that his behaviour met all ethical standards? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the opposition keeps talking about my finances, but i will continue to focus on retirement security for canadians. eos sos that is very important. eos"
sos the hon. eos sos member for beauce. eos,"sos mr. speaker, we have questions about the minister's conflicts of interest. eos sos he tabled a bill that will benefit him personally. eos"
"sos we have a very high growth rate, there are more jobs for canadians, and canadian families are better off. eos sos that is still our goal. eos","sos mr. speaker, as a bay street executive, the finance minister lobbied for pension legislation that would directly benefit his company. eos sos as minister of finance, he introduced the very same legislation, and his morneau shepell shares jumped in value. eos"
"sos unfortunately, the people opposite did not support our goal of enhancing the canada pension plan. eos sos i am so proud that we have come into office and actually worked on how we can improve the retirement outcomes for canadians by making sure we have a situation where people can retire at age 65, where those who need it have an increased guaranteed income supplement eos",sos the hon. eos sos member for chilliwack hope. eos
"sos it is very telling that not a single liberal member thought that the finance minister introducing the very legislation he had lobbied for as chairman of morneau shepell could present a bit of an ethics problem. eos sos did the finance minister receive written approval from the ethics commissioner to allow him to introduce pension legislation that he would personally profit from, or does the finance minister, like the prime minister, believe that the ethics rules do not apply to liberals like him? eos","sos mr. speaker, i will continue to work up to the highest standards of integrity of this house. eos sos what i know we can do to meet canadians' expectations is to do that while doing things to improve the economy but also improve their family situation. eos"
"sos it is simple: the sweeter the barbados deal is, the better it is for him. eos sos did the finance minister follow the law and recuse himself from all discussions regarding the tax treaty with barbados? eos","sos mr. speaker, maybe i can draw a distinction between different economic approaches. eos sos the members opposite had an idea for a decade that we could have trickle-down economics and maybe just wait for the benefits. eos"
sos can he answer the question that is on everyone's lips? eos sos did the minister recuse himself from the discussions on barbados or any other file that would open the door to potential conflicts of interest? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i know that it is very important to have a tax system that works well. eos sos we have been clear on that. eos"
"sos the minister of finance knows all about the benefits of barbados, such as a nice climate, beautiful beaches and, of course, a place to avoid paying taxes. eos sos i ask the finance minister simply: did he recuse himself from discussions around the canada-barbados tax treaty? eos","sos mr. speaker, while the members opposite obsess about my personal situation, i am going to remain resolutely focused on what we were elected to do, which was to help canadians. eos sos they have been subjected to a decade of a government that was not actually focused on helping them. eos"
"sos again, we ask a simple question. eos sos did the minister of finance recuse himself from any discussions around the canada-barbados tax treaty? eos","sos mr. speaker, as often as the members opposite want to focus on my personal situation, i am going to come back to them and tell them how well the economy is doing for canadians. eos sos we know that is what we are here to do. eos"
sos it is not like in a civilian court. eos sos can the liberals understand the impact on victims in the armed forces and provide them with better support? eos,"sos mr. speaker, inappropriate sexual behaviour of any kind is completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated in the canadian armed forces. eos sos our investigators now have better training. eos"
"sos in addition, victims fear reprisal or being ostracized when they testify in military court. eos sos will the prime minister, if he is really a committed feminist and believes in equality, take concrete actions to help these survivors? eos","sos mr. speaker, as i stated, inappropriate sexual behaviour of any kind is completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated. eos sos every person who willingly serves his or her country, despite the many dangers and sacrifices of military service, deserves a professional environment in which he or she is treated with respect and dignity. eos"
sos our government has repeatedly spoken out against the ethnic cleansing being perpetrated against the rohingya by the security forces in myanmar. eos sos would the minister of foreign affairs tell us what further steps the government is taking to address this terrible violence? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i would like to thank the member for york centre for his very hard work on this issue. eos sos i know we all agree that the ethnic cleansing and the crimes against humanity being perpetrated against the rohingya must stop. eos"
"sos we also know that he has shares in a number of other holding companies. eos sos when will the minister of finance meet with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner as promised, and will he finally disclose all of his other investments to the house so canadians will know if he is still in conflict of interest? eos","sos mr. speaker, while the opposition focuses on my finances, i am going to focus on the finances of canadians. eos sos that is very important. eos"
"sos as this very same situation might exist with his other corporate holdings, why not clear the air and simply disclose all of his investments in these companies? eos sos will he do so? eos","sos mr. speaker, i will continue to live up to the highest standards of integrity. eos sos i know that is important for canadians to have confidence. eos"
"sos instead he made millions off a company that he regulates as finance minister. eos sos in light of that record of deception, why should canadians believe the minister when he says he is not hiding other conflicts of interest in eight numbered companies that he owns? eos","sos mr. speaker, as i have said, while the members opposite may obsess over my personal situation, i think what canadians expect us to do is to continue to focus on their situation. eos sos the really good news is that our work on behalf of canadians is having the kind of impact canadians expected it to have, that we expected it to have. eos"
"sos now the minister is trying to hide his investments in eight numbered companies. eos sos if the minister really has nothing to hide, then why will he not disclose his investments? eos","sos mr. speaker, i will continue to live up to the highest standards that the prime minister expects of me and that canadians expect of me. eos sos i know that confidence is important. eos"

"sos there are horrifying media reports of women and girls being raped and murdered, and thousands of children who have witnessed the unspeakable are on their own, trying to survive amid the chaos and with the ever-present threat of disease hanging over them. eos sos can the minister of international development and la francophonie tell the house what the government has been doing lately to provide humanitarian assistance to the rohingya? eos","sos mr. speaker, i thank my colleague from saint-lonardsaint-michel for his question. eos sos we are all very concerned about the humanitarian situation in myanmar. eos"

"sos if the answer is no, then why is he pulling the same dirty trick on the people of beauharnois and awarding the contract for the kathryn spirit to the company that brought her there? eos sos is that what it means to respect the polluter pays principle? eos","sos mr. speaker, i will take this opportunity to say that our government is determined to protect the health and safety of canadians and our waters. eos sos we are doing what it takes to ensure that the permanent removal of the kathryn spirit is done safely and effectively, something that the previous government did not do. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, as we all know, canadian farmers are essential to the vitality of our rural regions and make a significant contribution to our national economy. eos sos [english] our government has placed a focus on agriculture, investing $100 million in agricultural science, improving the transportation system for grain farmers, and setting a target of $75 billion in exports by 2025. can the minister of agriculture please also update this house on canada's agricultural policy framework for the next five years? eos","sos mr. speaker, i was proud to stand with my provincial and territorial colleagues to sign the canadian agricultural partnership. eos sos this $3-billion investment will strengthen the canadian agricultural sector, ensuring continued innovation, growth, and prosperity. eos"
"sos when did the finance minister advise the prime minister that he was neither establishing a blind trust nor divesting his stock holdings? eos sos again, has the finance minister been served notice by the ethics commissioner of his violation of the conflict of interest act? eos","sos mr. speaker, i am pleased to say that i want to live up to the high standards the prime minister has set for all of our cabinet on ethical behaviour, and that is what i will continue to do. eos sos i know that is what allows us to do the work that is so important for canadians. eos"
"sos however, in true fashion, the liberals continue to protect their rich corporate friends instead of protecting the pensions and benefits of middle-class canadians. eos sos when will the finance minister stop this attack on workers' pensions, abandon bill c-27, and protect workers? eos","sos mr. speaker, we have risen on this situation several times in the house and expressed our deep concern for the sears workers, their families, and the many communities that have been impacted. eos sos that is why, as a government, we are working with sears representatives to see them through this difficult time and provide assistance. eos"
"sos therefore, his being caught and having to sell those shares is not virtuous enough. eos sos will he work with us to change the law to protect pensions in corporate bankruptcy, or will he continue to do the bidding of his friends at morneau shepell? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government has been very clear when it comes to securing pensions. eos sos this is a priority for us. eos"
"sos it was inevitable: as soon as quebec turns its attention to religious neutrality, ottawa goes berserk. eos sos will the prime minister confirm that he recognizes that religious neutrality within the quebec government falls under quebec jurisdiction, and not federal jurisdiction? eos","sos mr. speaker, we know that diversity is our strength, which is why canadians expect us to stand up for the canadian charter of rights and freedoms. eos sos we will always do so. eos"
sos this is yet another example showing that federalism does not work. eos sos will the prime minister promise not to use quebec money to challenge the quebec government's own bill62? eos,"sos mr. speaker, as i just said, we know that in this country, diversity is our strength. eos sos that is why we honour the canadian charter of rights and freedoms and will always defend it. eos"
sos how much longer will mr.fortin's children have to wait before they can settle their father's estate and finally find closure? eos sos i appeal to the minister's compassion. eos,"sos mr. speaker, our thoughts are with this family. eos sos resolving this as quickly as possible is our priority. eos"
"sos last weekend, we learned that in may2017, the liberals began to deny major tax credits to vulnerable diabetics, against the advice of doctors. eos sos how can the prime minister justify funding his reckless spending on the backs of diabetics? eos","sos mr. speaker, we are committed to ensuring that all canadians can access the credits and benefits to which they are entitled. eos sos we fully understand the concerns of these groups. eos"
"sos therefore, the question for the prime minister is simple. eos sos who is better placed to determine the needs of diabetics, tax collectors in ottawa or doctors on the ground? eos","sos mr. speaker, we are committed to ensuring that all canadians have access to the credits and benefits to which they are entitled. eos sos we understand the concerns expressed, because many canadians are touched by diabetes. eos"
sos can the prime minister tell us this. eos sos does he believe that raising taxes on vulnerable diabetic canadians is fair? eos,"sos mr. speaker, in the last election canadians had a choice: go for the conservative party that had continued to not grow the economy very quickly, and gave wealthy people the opportunity to have more benefits; or, go with a liberal government that is committed to invest in canadians and to grow the economy by putting more money in the pockets of the middle class. eos sos that is exactly what we promised to do. eos"
"sos local businesses will also pay more taxes. eos sos why is the prime minister working so hard to make life easier for his millionaire friends, while forcing middle-class canadians to pay more and more? eos","sos mr. speaker, as we saw last night in lac-saint-jean, canadians are not buying what the conservatives are selling. eos sos the conservatives brought in tax credits that did not help families. eos"
sos the premier of quebec even said that the american administration's demands were extreme and unacceptable. eos sos when will the minister of foreign affairs be firm with donaldtrump and tell him that supply management and the cultural exemption are non-negotiable? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i want to thank my colleague for her question and assure her, my colleagues, quebeckers, and canadians that the cultural exemption is a priority for our government. eos sos supply management is also a priority for our government. eos"
sos we need a stronger approach. eos sos when will the minister stand up against these blatant and extremely aggressive u.s. threats? eos,"sos mr. speaker, let me assure the member opposite and all canadians that at the negotiating table, i absolutely stand up for the canadian national interests. eos sos i believe that it is right to be polite and when we say  no , we say  no with a smile. eos"
"sos when a subsidized company contributes indirectly to morneau shepell's bottom line, that clearly puts the finance minister in conflict of interest. eos sos my question is a simple one: did the minister recuse himself from all discussions about subsidies with bombardier? eos","sos mr. speaker, as i said, the minister of finance has always worked with the ethics commissioner and will continue to do so transparently and proactively to make sure he is in full compliance with the rules that govern us all and to avoid any conflict of interest. eos sos by virtually every economic indicator, the conservatives gave us our worst 10 years since the second world war, and they neglected the middle class, so i can understand why they might not like it when we compare their record to ours. eos"
sos he misled the house about that. eos sos how can the minister of finance continue to act as the government's bagman while being in a conflict of interest because of his personal affairs? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the minister of finance can fulfill his role by acting on the recommendations of the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner and working with her, as he has done from the very beginning, to ensure full compliance with the laws and rules that govern us in the house. eos sos that is what he has been doing since he was elected and what he continues to do. eos"

"sos after two years and three compliance orders, the liberals have done nothing. eos sos when will the minister address this major problem that has been lingering in her department or does her government's most important relationship not include indigenous children? eos","sos mr. speaker, the documents the member opposite is referring to are based on jordan's principle, which was passed in the house in 2007. tragically, there were zero cases approved under the previous government. eos sos as soon as our government came into power, we got the resources, hundreds of millions of dollars, to fully implement jordan's principle. eos"
"sos health canada did draw a line in the sand, that it would not accept the definition that would ensure that first nations children have access to the same publicly funded health and social services . eos sos will the minister please explain why indigenous children do not have that right under her government? eos","sos mr. speaker, i would like to start by correcting the record. eos sos in fact i am working very closely with dr. cindy blackstock. eos"
"sos we discussed the challenges of social media messaging, opportunities to increase diversity in university leadership, and their plan moving forward. eos sos could the minister of status of women update the house on how this government is leading by example and delivering results for gender equality? eos","sos mr. speaker, my hon. eos sos colleague from new brunswick southwest knows that gender equality is fundamental to our collective success as a country and is at the core of our government's feminist agenda, and we are seeing the results: more economic growth. eos"
"sos diabetes canada says it is concerned that 80% of diabetics making applications are now being denied, whereas a year ago 80% were being approved. eos sos why do the liberals care more about protecting the wealthy finance minister than people with type 1 diabetes? eos","sos mr. speaker, this government is committed to ensuring that all canadians have access to the credits and benefits to which they are entitled. eos sos the concerns raised by the groups are important. eos"
sos she wrote that adults who independently manage their insulin therapy...are unlikely to meet the 14-hours...requirement . eos sos why did the minister defend these rejections? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government is committed to ensuring that all canadians have access to the credits and benefits to which they are entitled. eos sos as i said, in contrast to the former government, we simplified the forms. eos"
sos he has put himself above the law and he is throwing his colleague under the bus. eos sos can the minister of national revenue tell the house that people with type1 diabetes will be retroactively entitled to the tax credit? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i fully understand the concerns of people with diabetes. eos sos my husband died of diabetes-related complications. eos"
"sos however, when canadians suffering from diabetes try to access the tax credit, the liberals claim that they are somehow cheating the system. eos sos why are the liberals working so hard to protect the finance minister from paying his fair share while they go after canadians suffering from diabetes? eos","sos mr. speaker, i fully understand what diabetes can mean for diabetics and their families. eos sos as i was saying, my husband died of diabetes-related complications. eos"

"sos for two years, the minister resisted calls to address problems with the canada-barbados tax treaty, saying were not going to throw the baby out with the bathwatersome baby, some bath water. eos sos did the minister declare his morneau shepell barbados tax treaty conflict of interest to the ethics commissioner, yes or no? eos","sos mr. speaker, for two years the finance minister has worked with the ethics commissioner to make sure all recommendations are followed. eos sos for two years, the finance minister has grown our economy at its fastest pace in the last decade; has reduced unemployment to its lowest level since 2008; has created 400,000 jobs, most of them full-time; has reduced child poverty by 40%; and has helped 900,000 seniors. eos"

"sos it is within the rights of the national assembly to decide that people cannot receive quebec government services unless their face is uncovered. eos sos is it asking too much of the minister of canadian heritage to respect the quebec national assembly's jurisdiction, or does she believe that she is above the law, as she did in reaching an agreement with netflix? eos","sos mr. speaker, our position on the issue of diversity has always been clear. eos sos we have always maintained that we will defend the canadian charter of rights and freedoms and that it is not up to the state to tell someone what they can or cannot wear. eos"

"sos what a coincidence. eos sos when will the minister of finance admit that he has not fulfilled his obligations and that he has a real conflict of interest, as proven by the $2million he has personally pocketed since becoming finance minister? eos","sos mr. speaker, here are some more plain facts. eos sos as soon as he was appointed, the minister of finance met with the ethics commissioner to ensure that he was following all the rules we are subject to. eos"
"sos the minister must give us a straight answer. eos sos yes or no, did he tell the ethics commissioner that he was in a direct conflict of interest? eos","sos mr. speaker, there was no conflict of interest, because the minister of finance met with the ethics commissioner as soon as he took office to make sure he was following all of the rules that govern us. eos sos all of her recommendations, including putting a conflict of interest screen in place, were followed from day one. eos"
"sos however, i want to know something specific. eos sos given all of these conflicts around this issue, did the minister recuse himself from any of the discussions around bill c-27? eos","sos mr. speaker, the minister of finance did put in place an ethics screen, which was recommended by the ethics commissioner. eos sos she described it as the best measure of compliance possible. eos"
sos canadians want to know this. eos sos did the minister recuse himself when we had these discussions on bill c-27? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i can assure the member that the minister of finance, from the get-go, has always worked with the ethics commissioner to make sure he is in full compliance with the rules that govern us all as parliamentarians, and respected her recommendations. eos sos he has gone even further, going above and beyond her recommendations. eos"
"sos the minister promised the house, the ethics commissioner, the media, and anyone who would listen that he would recuse himself from decisions involving morneau shepell, but he has not done that. eos sos did the minister receive written approval from the ethics commissioner to introduce pension legislation that turned out to be a windfall for the minister and for morneau shepell? eos","sos mr. speaker, i can assure my colleague that the minister of finance will always work with the ethics commissioner to make sure he is in full compliance with all of the rules that govern us. eos sos last week, he announced that he would be going even further to avoid any distraction from the important work he does for canadians. eos"
"sos his conflicts of interests are in fact serious distractions. eos sos does the minister actually believe it was ethical of him to table bill c-27, knowing it would further feather his own nest? eos","sos mr. speaker, the ethics commissioner is there to preserve the integrity of this institution and of parliamentarians. eos sos we believe in the ethics commissioner and in her recommendations. eos"
sos i ask today. eos sos will the minister of national revenue tell the house that she will fully restore the meaning of this tax credit for type 1 diabetics? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government is committed to ensuring that everyone receives the tax credits and benefits to which they are entitled. eos sos i want to assure my colleague opposite that the law has not changed. eos"
"sos however, this is yet another example of the liberal government's failed boat-by-boat approach on abandoned vessels. eos sos why did the government do nothing to prevent this vessel sinking, and will the government support my legislation to solve abandoned vessels once and for all? eos","sos mr. speaker, we are very proud of having announced the oceans protection plan. eos sos in relation to vessels of concern, we announced the $6.8 million abandoned boats program last may. eos"

sos the minister of finance's company has contracts with bombardier and the minister was a strong proponent of the agreement. eos sos when did the prime minister learn that the minister of finance had a personal stake in the agreement with bombardier? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the opposition's misleading insinuations are baseless. eos sos there is no conflict of interest. eos"
"sos they are stuck with the bill for subsidizing it, except for morneau shepell, which has contracts with bombardier. eos sos when did the prime minister learn that the finance minister had a personal interest in the bombardier deal? eos","sos mr. speaker, on this side of the house, we have always stood up for canadian aerospace workers, and we will continue to. eos sos we know those are good jobs right across the country. eos"
"sos i would ask the member for battle river crowfoot, the member for edmonton riverbend, and the member for cypress hillsgrasslands to try to restrain themselves and not interrupt, in accordance with standing order 18. the hon. eos sos leader of the opposition. eos","sos mr. speaker, let us take a look at what canadians got for their $400-million bombardier bailout. eos sos the c series technology has been given to the europeans, and the jobs have been sent to alabama. eos"

sos he even tried to claim that the reason why this happened was because there are not enough people working at the canada revenue agency. eos sos when will the prime minister come clean and just explain to canadians why he chose to cancel much-needed help for those suffering with diabetes? eos,"sos mr. speaker, this government will ensure that people access the benefits to which they are entitled. eos sos this is something that we are continuing to focus on. eos"
sos what does he say to the hundreds of thousands of canadians suffering from this disease? eos sos why did he take their benefit away? eos,"sos mr. speaker, as canadians expect of us, we will ensure that everyone who is entitled to these benefits gets these benefits. eos sos our focus is on supporting people suffering, supporting the middle class and those working hard to join it, and making sure that canadians who need help get it. eos"
sos this company specializes in the pension plans that this minister directly regulates. eos sos why does the prime minister continue to protect him? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the opposition's misleading insinuations are simply baseless. eos sos there is no conflict of interest. eos"
sos why does the prime minister refuse to close these loopholes in the conflict of interest act? eos sos is it because they hope to continue exploiting them? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i feel bad for the ndp. eos sos mudslinging is all they have left, because the economic news is positive and we are currently helping the most vulnerable canadians, putting money in the pockets of those who need it the most, and creating inclusive economic growth. eos"
"sos the prime minister must believe there are two sets of rules, one for him and his buddies and another set for everyone else. eos sos while canadians are worried about protecting their pensions, why is the prime minister only worried about protecting his finance minister? eos","sos mr. speaker, over the past weeks i have been criss-crossing the country and talking with voters in alberta and lac-saint-jean about the issues they are facing. eos sos the people who were talking with me were grateful for the canada child benefit that helps nine out of 10 canadian families, grateful that the first thing we did was lower taxes on the middle class and raise them on the wealthiest 1%, and pleased that we are now lowering small business taxes to the lowest rate in the g7. eos"
"sos if the prime minister really wants to clear the cloud over his finance minister's head, will he allow the minister to show up or will he once again shove him aside and out of the way? eos sos what is it going to be? eos","sos mr. speaker, on this side of the house we are incredibly pleased with the work of the finance minister. eos sos he has lowered taxes for the middle class and raised them for the wealthiest 1%. eos"
sos we now know that the company morneau shepell has bombardier as a client. eos sos what else is the finance minister hiding in his vast network of numbered companies and trust funds? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i was happy to talk with people in lac-saint-jean about bombardier, about the work we are doing to protect aerospace workers, about the work we are doing to protect forestry workers, about what we are delivering for agricultural communities and families, and about what we are delivering directly to canadians and the nine out of 10 families who need help with the canada child benefit. eos sos these are the kinds of things that people were talking to me about, and the conservative party is once again showing itself to be completely out of touch with the priorities of canadians. eos"
"sos he hid his offshore company in france, he hid his $20 million share in his family business. eos sos what else is he hiding in his vast network of numbered companies and trust funds? eos","sos mr. speaker, canadians know there is a lot of back and forth that goes on in this house, and one of the things that matters to them is that we have a commissioner who is in charge of ensuring that the behaviour of all of the people in this house meets the high standards of canadians. eos sos the minister of finance worked with the ethics commissioner, followed her advice, and is willing to go above and beyond what she recommended two years ago. eos"
"sos however, the prime minister is not insisting that he be transparent with the taxpayers who will have to pay for those very loans and loan guarantees. eos sos therefore, once again, will the prime minister require that his finance minister reveal to all canadians what he holds in his numbered companies? eos","sos mr. speaker, once again, we have an adversarial system in this house that requires the members opposite to try to attack and ask whatever questions they have. eos sos however, canadians are reassured to know that we have a conflict of interest and ethics commissioner who oversees the actual behaviours of everyone in this house and makes determinations on how they should move forward. eos"
sos the only way for us to find out if he is hiding anything else and if he is profiting privately from his public powers is for him to reveal what is inside those companies. eos sos why will he not? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the fundamental question here is whether or not the opposition trusts the ethics commissioner to be professional and to do her job. eos sos i can understand the personal attacks they feel are their best way to play politics, but the fact is, we trust the ethics commissioner and we follow her advice, which is exactly what the finance minister did. eos"
sos imagine what we do not know. eos sos does the prime minister realize that he must absolutely ask the minister to disclose all of his assets in order to clear the air? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i am very pleased that the member wants to talk about yesterday's economic update because it was very good news for the canadian economy. eos sos two years ago, we promised to put more money in the pockets of the middle class, to help those working hard to join it, and to invest in our communities. eos"
sos the hon. eos sos member for louis-saint-laurent. eos,"sos mr. speaker, let us talk about the minister's speech from yesterday. eos sos yesterday, the minister of finance practically tried to make us feel sorry for him when he talked about how he and his family, who are very rich people, were now paying more taxes. eos"
sos the right hon. eos sos prime minister. eos,"sos mr. speaker, for 10 years, the previous conservative government handed out benefits to the wealthy. eos sos that did not create the economic growth that canadians expect. eos"
"sos in northern saskatchewan, i constantly hear from constituents about their difficulty finding affordable and adequate housing. eos sos why are the liberals still ignoring these shortfalls? eos","sos mr. speaker, no relationship is more important than the one between our government and indigenous peoples. eos sos that is why we invested over $8.4 billion over five years to build and create opportunities and infrastructure and services in indigenous communities. eos"
"sos there is something fundamentally wrong in a nation where indigenous families have to give their children away, while we have a finance minister who cannot remember that he owns a villa in the south of france. eos sos will the prime minister call off his lawyers, stop blaming the provinces, and end this system of child-focused apartheid in canada, and do it now? eos","sos mr. speaker, we feel passionately about the need to create nation-to-nation relationship and opportunities to set indigenous communities on the kind of path they have not been on for centuries because of the oppressive policies of this place and previous governments. eos sos we are working very hard to fix that relationship, to move forward on a true path of reconciliation with indigenous peoples. eos"
"sos after 3,000 testimonials, 252 briefings, and 18 months of consultations, the liberals refuse to listen to anyone, including the community, the experts, the deputy minister, and even the minister herself, according to the news. eos sos who was the prime minister listening to when he decided to sell out canada's cultural sovereignty? eos","sos mr. speaker, on the contrary, we are proud of the work we have done with the cultural community and creative sector across the country. eos sos they have proven that they are world class institutions and that we should be able to share our stories, not only with quebeckers and canadians, but with our fellow citizens worldwide, who, incidentally, want to hear our stories. eos"
sos it is simple. eos sos why did the prime minister create an advisory committee and conduct consultations if he just keeps ignoring them? eos,"sos mr. speaker, this committee told us that canadian producers and creators are extraordinary and that they deserve more platforms to share their productions around the world in the digital age. eos sos that is exactly what we want to do, and that is exactly why we are looking for investors to create more jobs and more productions in canada. eos"
"sos as i hear jeers from across the aisle, i know this program is lifting 300,000 canadian children out of poverty. eos sos could the prime minister advise this house how we are enhancing this incredible program to deliver change for canadians? eos","sos mr. speaker, our plan has always been to invest in canadians and to trust canadians. eos sos that is why, yesterday, we announced that the tax-free canada child benefit will be fully indexed two years ahead of schedule. eos"
"sos that is .01%. eos sos why will the liberal government not stop reviving frankenstein, and kill the tpp for good? eos","sos mr. speaker, unlike the ndp, we are a pro-trade party. eos sos however, unlike the conservatives, we believe in good trade deals. eos"
"sos the liberals changed the process, resulting in an 80% denial rate for applicants suffering from type 1 diabetes. eos sos does the prime minister really think that this latest tax grab on vulnerable canadians is helping the middle class, or is it just a desperate attempt to raise additional money to fund an out-of-control spending problem? eos","sos mr. speaker, we are ensuring that all canadians who deserve benefits and qualify for benefits get them. eos sos however, again, the allegations and the insinuations of the members opposite that we are spending money in the wrong places really makes us wonder, what are the investments they have such issue with? eos"
sos the hon. eos sos member for central okanagansimilkameennicola. eos,"sos mr. speaker, it is incredible that the liberals are taking money away from the most vulnerable. eos sos every day, we hear more and more cases of type 1 diabetics who had previously been approved but have now been rejected for the disability tax credit. eos"
"sos the fact is we are going to continue to stay focused on canadians who need the support and need the help. eos sos unfortunately, the conservatives for 10 years chose to do things like closing veterans offices and eliminating health benefits for eos",sos the hon. eos sos member for bellechasse les etchemins lvis. eos
sos for years these people have been getting their credit automatically through their doctors. eos sos why is it easier for the prime minister to protect the minister of finance than it is to take care of a woman with diabetes in sainte-justine? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we will continue to work on ensuring that people who are eligible for assistance receive that assistance. eos sos our government's priority is to help the most vulnerable and help those who are in need. eos"
sos our plan grows the economy and provides opportunities for people to join the middle class. eos sos can the prime minister tell the house what we are doing to help vulnerable canadians? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we know that we have a responsibility to support those who are working hard and who need just a little help. eos sos yesterday, we announced that we will further increase the working income tax benefit by $500 million per year. eos"
"sos the united states is withdrawing from unesco, as is israel. eos sos when will canada and the liberals take a stand? eos","sos mr. speaker, we have taken a stand. eos sos we believe in ensuring a strong canadian voice within unesco to continue to stand up for israel, to continue to stand up for good projects around the world, to continue to be the voice that canadians and, indeed, people around the world expect from our representatives to stand up and fight for what is right. eos"
"sos what is the government waiting for? eos sos when will it help to improve the situations of first nations, the working poor, children, unemployed workers, people with disabilities, families, and refugees in order to make them less vulnerable? eos","sos mr. speaker, i thank the member for her question because it gives me an opportunity to repeat what we announced yesterday. eos sos we are in the process of ensuring that the canada child benefit is indexed to the cost of living. eos"
sos our government is committed to renewing the relationship with indigenous peoples and providing the infrastructure they need to prosper. eos sos could the prime minister give us an idea of the kind of work the government is doing to improve access to drinking water and wastewater treatment on reserves? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i thank the member from nickel belt for his question. eos sos the state of indigenous peoples' drinking water and wastewater treatment systems is unacceptable. eos"
"sos we do not know who they are, where they are, or what their plans are. eos sos why has the prime minister not been proactive in informing canadians about these criminals, and what mechanisms are being put in place to keep canadians safe? eos","sos mr. speaker, i can assure the hon. eos sos member and all canadians that our intelligence services and the rcmp are working very hard to keep canadians safe every day. eos"
sos this is unacceptable. eos sos will the prime minister tell his minister she needs to stop failing francophone producers and to make a minimum commitment of $133million? eos,"sos on the contrary, mr. speaker, under the deal we signed with netflix, it will invest $25million in the development of projects in quebec. eos sos an additional $500million will go to creators across canada. eos"
"sos today we wrote to the prime minister, asking him to initiate a special parliamentary investigation into the liquidation of sears. eos sos will the prime minister initiate an investigation, and commit to changing bankruptcy and insolvency laws to protect canadian workers, retirees, and their families, yes or no? eos","sos mr. speaker, of course our hearts go out to the workers affected by the decision taken by sears. eos sos we are making every effort to connect sears' employees and pensioners with programs and services that will help them through this tough time. eos"
"sos the provinces were not found guilty of discrimination; the federal government was. eos sos when will the liberals stop blaming everyone else, live up to their responsibilities, and put an end to discrimination? eos","sos mr. speaker, i hope that the member opposite, as well as all members in this house, recognize the very severe circumstances that indigenous children are facing, with more than 50% of the children in care in this country being indigenous children. eos sos we have to all work together to address this very serious problem. eos"
"sos there has been $6 million of taxpayer money wasted fighting first nations children in court. eos sos therefore, for chantel, for jolynn, and for all the other children falling through the cracks, will the minister just call off your lawyers, do the right thing, and end that federal court case today? eos",sos the hon. eos sos member for timminsjames bay is an experienced member and knows that he should be directing his comments to the chair. eos
"sos close to 19,000 cases have been requested. eos sos we are working to make sure all children will get access to the care they need, and making sure it is done right. eos",sos i am afraid i will have to ask the hon member for north islandpowell river not to be heckling throughout the answer. eos sos the hon. eos
"sos the finance minister keeps saying that canadians should trust the ethics commissioner, but what he is really telling us to do is trust his liberal staff. eos sos does the minister expect canadians to trust a system that is being enforced by someone who was hired by and reports to the minister himself? eos","sos mr. speaker, for clarity, the ethics commissioner suggested a conflict of interest screen. eos sos the way that screen is administered, which is consistent with the previous government's approach, is that the department of finance identifies the issues that should be put forward as conflicts of interest, and then that is administered through my chief of staff. eos"
"sos we now know that, for two years, the only person policing the minister's ethics has been his senior political staffer. eos sos when will the finance minister disclose what else he is hiding in the web of numbered companies, to finally ensure that no more conflicts of interest exist? eos","sos mr. speaker, i do not know what to say other than that the member opposite is flat out wrong. eos sos the situation we have been using has been an appropriate conflict of interest screen, as recommended by the ethics commissioner. eos"
"sos however, i can see why he is smiling because the person in charge of his ethical screen is his chief of staff, who, of course, does not have any idea what ethics are, as we learned this morning in the globe and mail. eos sos when will the minister finally act in the interest of all canadians? eos","sos mr. speaker, to repeat, the commissioner said the conflict of interest screen was the best measure to ensure there were no conflicts. eos sos all i can assume is that the member opposite is actually questioning the commissioner. eos"
"sos in short, the ethical screen that the minister claims to have in place is a sham. eos sos what else is the minister hiding about his other numbered companies? eos","sos mr. speaker, there is a reason why the member wants to talk about my finances and that is because he does not want to talk about canadians' finances. eos sos however, that is our goal. eos"
"sos apparently, the americans. eos sos is this preferential treatment for netflix and web giants part of the minister's vision, or just an idea from the lobbyists camped out in the prime minister's office? eos","sos mr. speaker, in the course of our consultations, we heard from over 30,000 people and we listened to the quebec and francophone cultural sector. eos sos i understand the concerns of the cultural sector, which is precisely why we are investing in it. eos"
"sos now we have learned that other digital giants, like google, have lobbied the government 63 times. eos sos are we going to see more sweetheart deals with these massive corporations, and why is the government so focused on preventing big businesses from paying their fair share? eos","sos mr. speaker, in the context of our consultations, we heard from 30,000 people from across the country, and i have been in close contact with the cultural sector throughout the country. eos sos we announced some key investments in the context of our creative canada strategy. eos"

"sos our minister of public safety was in the united states pleading with the americans to help solve the illegal-border-crossing crisis, which we know has already created massive backlogs and a long-term impact on canada's social assistance system. eos sos what he failed to do was even broach the topic of closing the loophole in the safe third country agreement with president trump, which begs the question: when will the prime minister stand up to president trump and for canadian interests and make him close the loophole? eos","sos mr. speaker, i am very glad to have this opportunity to note that last weekend, at the g7 meetings in italy, i had the opportunity for a bilateral discussion with the acting secretary of homeland security. eos sos we discussed a variety of issues pertaining to the canada-u.s. relationship, including the value of our border, a border that accommodates 400,000 travellers every day, a border that accommodates $2.5 billion in trade every day, and a border that we are both dedicated to thinning and making more efficient and more secure for both countries. eos"
"sos why did the liberals not stand up for the official languages and, above all, for quebeckers, acadians, and franco-ontarians? eos sos have they abandoned their principles? eos","sos mr. speaker, i appreciate standing to speak about the supreme court of canada process that our prime minister put in place to not only appoint one supreme court justice but to move toward supporting another supreme court justice in the very near future. eos sos our prime minister and our government are fundamentally committed to appointing supreme court justices who are functionally bilingual, have the highest meritorious qualities, and represent the diversity of the country. eos"
sos the notice was submitted to interpol one day after this parliament unanimously passed magnitsky legislation. eos sos does the minister of public safety believe this is an appropriate use of interpol resources? eos,"sos mr. speaker, no, canada vehemently disagrees with the russian government's abuse and misuse of the interpol listing system. eos sos the kremlin does not determine admissibility to canada. eos"
sos could he let the prime minister know? eos sos there seems to be some confusion over there. eos,"sos mr. speaker, diversity is canada's strength. eos sos canadians expect our government to defend the canadian charter of rights and freedoms. eos"
sos it is as simple as that. eos sos will the prime minister listen to his minister of families instead of his minister of canadian heritage and let quebec legislate in areas under its jurisdiction? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i understand that my colleague is very concerned about this issue and that she is trying to play politics with it, but our position has always been clear. eos sos we will defend the canadian charter of rights and freedoms. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, i seek permission to table two documents that will establish that there in fact was a change of policy and process under which the applications for type 2 diabetics are processed. eos",sos there appears to be no consent. eos
"sos mr. speaker, i am rising to ask if the government house leader would please share with us what we will be looking at for the remainder of this week and next week when we come back. eos","sos mr. speaker, in a few minutes, we will begin examining billc-17 on the yukon. eos sos tomorrow, we will begin debate at third reading of billc-46 on impaired driving. eos"

"sos the 80% of people who were receiving the credit became the 80% denied. eos sos why are the liberals taxing the vulnerable to pay for their out-of-control spending, and will the minister immediately instruct her agents to return to the criteria used in april this year? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government is committed to ensuring that all canadians have access to the credits and benefits to which they are entitled. eos sos let me be absolutely clear. eos"
sos what message is the government sending to public servants to get them to take money away from the most vulnerable? eos sos when will the government accept that it is solely responsible for this and give kat and all diabetics their money and their dignity back? eos,"sos mr. speaker, there has been no change to the eligibility criteria for dtc in relation to diabetes. eos sos we have heard the concerns raised by these groups. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, this week both the minister and the prime minister have insisted that neither the law nor its interpretation regarding the disability tax credit have changed in any way, but we know that the liberals changed the application process in may to reduce tax credit approvals for type 1 diabetics. eos sos will the liberals finally admit that they are so desperate for cash that they are raising taxes on diabetics? eos","sos mr. speaker, let me again be absolutely clear. eos sos there have been no changes in terms of the eligibility criteria for dtc for people with diabetes. eos"
"sos the liberals refused to allow this evidence to be tabled. eos sos having made a decision to raise taxes on diabetics, why are they now denying responsibility for their actions? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government is committed to ensuring that all canadians have access to the credits and benefits to which they are entitled. eos sos let me be absolutely clear. eos"

"sos they are raising taxes on bus passes, kids' hockey, and piano lessons, yet this minister of sport, like all liberals, always finds money to help himself and his friends, like the minister did for his father. eos sos why is the taxpayer on the hook for the liberals' generosity to their friends and insiders? eos","sos mr. speaker, i always appreciate the opportunity to rise in this place and remind canadians of the important work this government is doing: the historic investments in infrastructure, by working with provinces, territories, and municipalities; lowering the tax rate on small businesses from 11% in 2015 to 9% in 2019. this government has given more money to families with children who need it the most under the canada child benefit to ensure that those families that need it are able to help grow this economy. eos sos this government will continue to make strategic investments to ensure that canadians are succeeding. eos"
"sos the reality is that the minister of finance still owns numbered companies. eos sos if he truly wants to be honest with all canadians, when will he declare all his assets in his numbered companies? eos","sos madam speaker, the minister of finance has only ever acted with the interest of canadians in mind. eos sos under his leadership, our economy has grown faster than it has in the past 10 years, and the unemployment rate is lower than it has been in the past 10 years. eos"
"sos the question remains. eos sos why does the minister of finance not declare all of his assets held in numbered companies, so that canadians can finally have the truth? eos","sos madam speaker, all members of parliament and parliamentarians are required to work with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner and to be fully transparent with her. eos sos she makes recommendations based on each person's situation. eos"

"sos since there are so many young people here today, i would like to ask the prime minister one simple question. eos sos is breaking the law now the new normal for the prime minister of canada and his cabinet ministers? eos","sos mr. speaker, i am pleased the member for barrie innisfil brought up the young people in this place today. eos sos it is important for them to know that despite the back and forth that gets quite robust sometimes, particularly on wednesdays, we do have a system that ensures that beyond partisanship, everyone in this place follows the rules. eos"
"sos where i come from in barrie innisfil, one is either accountable or one justifies. eos sos how can the prime minister keep making excuses for the minister of finance? eos","sos mr. speaker, on the contrary, i am demonstrating that we respect, work with, and follow the advice of the ethics commissioner. eos sos however, i know the member for barrie innisfil wants to know how kids in his riding are doing. eos"
"sos however, our oceans are under threat from climate change, overfishing, and pollution. eos sos this is why we promised canadians in the last election to protect 5% of our oceans by the end of this year and 10% by 2020. could the prime minister update the house on the status of this commitment? eos","sos mr. speaker, i want to the thank the member for cloverdalelangley city for his hard work. eos sos in 2015, we promised to protect 5% of canada's oceans by 2017, and we have delivered: 5.22% or our marine and coastal areas are now protected, up from less than 1% two years ago. eos"
sos families i met with told me how the liberals had taken thousands of dollars from rdsps used for saving for their disabled children's future. eos sos could the prime minister please explain to canadians exactly how shaking down our most vulnerable citizens is a fair and balanced approach on taxes? eos,"sos on the contrary, mr. speaker, this government is committed to supporting our most vulnerable citizens. eos sos that is why we are moving forward with a national disability act that will remove barriers through access and success for all canadians who live with disabilities. eos"
"sos it makes no sense. eos sos instead of letting the minister of national revenue play doctor, when will the prime minister give shayne his tax credit back? eos","sos mr. speaker, we are still in the process of ensuring that everyone who is eligible for benefits is receiving them. eos sos it is important to recognize that far too many canadians are struggling and need help. eos"
sos enough is enough. eos sos when will the prime minister stop treating canada's most vulnerable as if they are tax cheats? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we are committed to ensuring that all canadians have access to the credits and benefits to which they are entitled. eos sos we have made it easier to access services with the support of the disability tax credit. eos"
sos she is overriding the decision of doctors. eos sos will he tell her to stop interfering politically and cancel this tax increase on our most vulnerable canadians? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the fact is that canadians do not believe conservatives when they come forward with these sorts of things. eos sos it is the conservative government that cut health benefits for refugees. eos"
"sos when you get into trouble, you get out the cheque book and assume that $5million will make everything go away? eos sos if the minister of finance is not living on another planet far away from middle-class canadians, he will withdraw bill c-27. eos","sos mr. speaker, once again, we recognize that opposition members have an obligation to try to make personal attacks on government members, but in our democratic system, our parliamentary system, we have commissioners who are responsible for ensuring that rules are followed and to fix any issues that come up. eos sos canadians have confidence in this system and all parliamentarians can have confidence in it. eos"
"sos meanwhile, canadian pensioners remain at the mercy of that privatized pension king of bay street. eos sos will the prime minister withdraw bill c-27 and put his minister in his place? eos","sos mr. speaker, with regard to our seniors, it is this minister of finance who negotiated a historic strengthening of the canada pension plan within his first months of being in office. eos sos this is a minister who increased the guaranteed income supplement for our most vulnerable seniors by close to $1,000. eos"
"sos the government is going to transfer up to half a billion dollars into this bank for infrastructure outside of canada, while at the same time the pbo reports the government is behind on infrastructure spending within canada. eos sos why is the government spending money on infrastructure projects halfway across the world when it is behind on fixing our worn out bridges, roads, and highways right here at home? eos","sos mr. speaker, unlike the member opposite, our party ran on a platform of investing in our communities, of putting forward record amounts of infrastructure investments
              
                some hon. eos sos members: oh, oh! eos"
sos the right hon. eos sos prime minister has the floor. eos,"sos mr. speaker, we chose to invest in our communities, to invest in infrastructure, bridges, roads, public transit systems, and wastewater systems that our municipalities and provinces needed, that our citizens needed. eos sos we are going to continue to do that. eos"
sos canada is our home. eos,sos order. eos sos i would encourage the hon. eos
"sos [english]
              budget 2017 is the next step in our government's ambitious plan to make smart investments that will create jobs, grow our economy, and provide more opportunities for the middle class in my riding of vaughanwoodbridge and across canada. eos sos [translation] could the prime minister tell the house what we are doing to put the middle class first? eos","sos mr. speaker, i thank the member for vaughanwoodbridge for his question and i congratulate him on his bilingualism. eos sos canadians are at the heart of our plan for a more innovative economy that creates jobs for the middle class. eos"
"sos the recent moratorium on oil and gas, although beneficial for the arctic environment, also removes this potential own-source revenue. eos sos how will the prime minister work with the new territorial government to improve our standard of living, and achieve a stable and self-sustaining economy in nunavut? eos","sos mr. speaker, we believe in real collaboration to support families, to build sustainable communities, and to create robust economies. eos sos we are committed to working with the newly elected officials of nunavut on a new arctic policy framework which will replace the outdated northern strategy. eos"
"sos however, what guarantees do we have that this information will be kept confidential here in canada, in toronto? eos sos who will make sure that the personal information of canadians remains confidential, and where will this data be stored? eos","sos mr. speaker, this government takes the responsibility of protecting canadians' privacy and personal information very seriously. eos sos that is why we are working hard to improve and modernize our systems to show that canadians control the information of canadians. eos"
"sos however, canadians are concerned and want to know who owns the data, and what will be done with it. eos sos what guarantees will the prime minister give that the privacy of canadians will be protected? eos","sos mr. speaker, we know the world is changing in a rapid way. eos sos it is important canadians not just be part of it but help shape the way the world is going to change in a way that respects people's rights and freedoms and privacy. eos"
"sos earlier this week, our government introduced bill c-64 in parliament to address this important issue. eos sos could the prime minister please update canadians on the new measures included in this unprecedented legislation? eos","sos mr. speaker, i thank the member for south shorest. eos sos margarets for her advocacy on this important file. eos"
"sos by a strange coincidence, billc-27, a bill designed to do just that, was tabled a few months later by the minister of finance. eos sos if the prime minister loves the middle class so much, why did he let his finance minister table a bill that attacks workers' pensions in order to line his cronies' pockets? eos","sos mr. speaker, i am happy to talk about what we are doing for the middle class, for workers, and for our pensioners. eos sos we reversed the previous conservative government's decision to increase the retirement age from 65 to 67. we are currently giving almost $1,000 more a year to our most vulnerable seniors, and we have made major improvements to the canada pension plan for the first time in generations, because we know that investing in our workers' retirement funds is important for the future. eos"
sos tabling a bill that places the burden of risk and accountability on pensioners is not working for the middle class; it is working for corporate interests. eos sos will the prime minister stop spewing talking points about the middle class and really help them by withdrawing bill c-27? eos,"sos mr. speaker, from the beginning of this government's mandate, we have focused on helping the middle class in concrete ways, whether it was lowering taxes for the middle class and raising them on the wealthiest 1% or delivering the canada child benefit, which helps families directly, including in north island powell river where 14,350 young people will be receiving larger cheques every month. eos sos it will help with the high cost of raising families. eos"
"sos however, the prime minister assured us that the finance minister was the only one to do so. eos sos the question is simple: how many other cabinet ministers are using the same loophole and who are they? eos","sos mr. speaker, the member seems to have some trouble with numbers. eos sos what i can say is that two is less than five. eos"
sos why can this minister not just answer simple questions? eos sos who are the other ministers and how many are there? eos,"sos mr. speaker, yesterday, in this chamber, i had a member of the opposition come over to tell me not to take it personally because what happens here is just a game. eos sos for our government it is absolutely not a game. eos"
"sos in the case of the finance minister, it lasted two years. eos sos all that the opposition wants to know and all that canadians want to know is who are the ministers who are using similar loopholes, how many are there, and when did the prime minister know this was going on? eos","sos mr. speaker, the member opposite is wrong, and he knows he is wrong. eos sos i disclosed all of my assets to the ethics commissioner and will continue to work with her. eos"
"sos shame on you, bill , you're being dishonest. eos sos you're being very dishonest. eos","sos i would ask the hon. eos sos member for carleton and others to listen to the answers, as well as the questions, of course. eos"
"sos it is helping their families. eos sos that is what we are working to do, and we will continue to do so. eos","sos mr. speaker, i would be happy if the minister could tell me how i am wrong. eos sos am i wrong when i say that the minister hid his assets for two years? eos"
"sos some hon. eos sos members: oh, oh! eos",sos i have to ask the hon. eos sos member for brandonsouris to remember not to speak unless he has the floor. eos
"sos is that some kind of a compliance fine that she issued him? eos sos my last question for the finance minister would be that if he actually if he did disclose his assets for the past few years, will he be asking for his $200 back? eos","sos mr. speaker, what i can say to the member opposite is: wrong again. eos sos what happened here is that i disclosed all of my assets, and in fact there was an administrative error that we satisfied the commissioner with the $200 fine i paid. eos"
"sos they could have accomplished that with billc-58, but the bill falls far short of the mark. eos sos why is the prime minister backtracking rather than forming a government that is truly open and transparent? eos","sos mr. speaker, after more than 30 years, we are the first government to modernize the access to information act, and we are applying it to ministers' offices through proactive disclosure. eos sos i understand why the ndp does not like proactive disclosure. eos"
"sos from the sponsorship scandal to missing and murdered aboriginal women and girls, all of this came to light through access to information. eos sos will the minister listen to civil society, immigration groups, and first nations, and fix this bad bill? eos","sos mr. speaker, we are proud to be the first government in more than 30 years to modernize the access to information act. eos sos i want to be very clear on a specific issue the hon. eos"
"sos experts who appeared before the standing committee on foreign affairs and international development talked about the serious concerns they have. eos sos will the government agree to amend the bill, or even better, withdraw it and start over? eos","sos mr. speaker, we are keeping our election promise to join the arms trade treaty. eos sos regulating the illicit trade in weapons is essential for the protection of human rights. eos"
sos i ask the minister again. eos sos will the government amend the bill or withdraw it and start over? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i am proud to assure members of this house and all canadians that we are delivering on our campaign commitment to join the arms trade treaty. eos sos tackling the illicit trade in weapons is essential for the protection of people and of human rights. eos"
"sos they certainly have no shortage of needs, including funding for post-secondary studies, access to affordable housing, help to cope with growing food insecurity, and a national day care system, to name but a few. eos sos when will the minister of youth finally put his money where his mouth is and support youth? eos","sos mr. speaker, i can say that we are very proud of our historic investments in young canadians across the country. eos sos first, we boosted the canada summer jobs program by an unprecedented $300million. eos"
"sos he said that others do not know what assets are, when he is the one who just forgot to report his asset, an offshore company in france, to the ethics commissioner. eos sos instead of lashing out at others, why does the finance minister not just let go of all the secrets and tell canadians what he is hiding in all of his holding companies? eos","sos mr. speaker, earlier today, i was speaking to the member for milton. eos sos i want to be clear that i was not questioning her numeracy skills. eos"
sos the hon. eos sos member for carleton. eos,"sos mr. speaker, the only way to know if he is making canadians better off instead of just making himself better off is just to reveal what investments he has held over the last two years in his vast network of holding companies and trust funds. eos sos we just recently found out that the minister was taking $65,000 a month in dividends from a company that he simultaneously regulated. eos"
sos the hon. eos sos minister of finance. eos,"sos mr. speaker, to repeat, we have a process in this house that we work with the ethics commissioner so that we can expose all of our assets to her and that is in fact what i have done. eos sos in terms of disclosure, 100% disclosure is the highest number we can get. eos"
sos we need to know what other inappropriate investments the minister might be hiding in his holding companies. eos sos why does he not tell us what is in those companies? eos,"sos mr. speaker, to repeat, working with the ethics commissioner is the approach we have in this house. eos sos it is to respect the officer of parliament who has that duty. eos"
sos when will the hon. eos sos member do the right thing and apologize to canadians for his mistakes? eos,"sos mr. speaker, what i will continue to do with canadians is listen to their issues, make sure that we are addressing them, and move forward not only to ensure that we have a high level of economic growth in the country but that canadians see the benefits of that growth for themselves and their families. eos sos that is what we have been doing for the last couple of years. eos"
"sos to the minister, stop defending the same feeble funding formula for child welfare established by stephen harper. eos sos why will the minister refuse to flow that money that was ordered by the parliament of canada? eos","sos mr. speaker, we have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to bringing equity for children in this country. eos sos as it relates to child and family services and the gaps that exist there, we recognize that we are facing a national crisis in terms of the way indigenous children are overrepresented in the child welfare system. eos"
"sos in montreal, 25,000families are on the waiting list for social housing, and in toronto, 58,000community housing units are in need of immediate repair. eos sos as the minister prepares to announce the details of his housing strategy, will he commit to investing the funding necessary to maintain and expand social housing stock? eos","sos mr. speaker, there is no issue on which i stand with a prouder sense of commitment and accomplishment than on the issue of housing. eos sos not only in the first budget did we double the amount of money going to provinces and our partners in the municipalities, but we have now committed to a 10-year program to create the first ever national strategy for housing. eos"
"sos they are now preparing to centralize the arts by transferring a wide range of artifacts from quebec city, the bastion of the canadian francophonie, to the nation's capital. eos sos will the member for qubec promise us that he will fight in cabinet to reverse this decision? eos","sos mr. speaker, parks canada primarily exhibits the objects under its care at parks canada-administered national parks and national historic sites in every province and territory. eos sos in 2012, parks canada decided to build a purpose-built collection facility to ensure the sustainable care and management of the collection not currently on display throughout canada. eos"
"sos we know that quebec, not ottawa, will have to pick up the tab for costs related to health and security. eos sos will the government promise to leave that money to quebec, or will it once again try to line its own pockets without even doing a thing? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government has been working very closely with our provincial and territorial partners. eos sos there have been ongoing discussions with the provinces and territories about the appropriate taxation and price regimens to be put in place. eos"
"sos that is a fundamental right. eos sos will the government respect quebec's jurisdiction, as stated in the motion we adopted, and will it promise not to pay for any legal challenge to quebec's religious neutrality law? eos","sos mr. speaker, our position on the issue has always been clear. eos sos we will always promote and protect rights and freedoms because we believe in the importance of the canadian charter of rights and freedoms. eos"
sos i have a simple question. eos sos will the minister create a permanent dedicated annual fund for coastal debris cleanup? eos,"sos mr. speaker, my colleague is right, we are very proud of our oceans protection plan, which now has approached its first-year anniversary and we have announced over 50 measures. eos sos with respect to ships that lose cargo, it is very clear that they are responsible for the cleaning. eos"
"sos indeed, liberals on the health committee already voted down an ndp motion to allow provinces to develop production regimes that would support local economies. eos sos as the government moves to legalize the recreational use of cannabis, will it stand with and support economically important, small-scale outdoor farmers across canada and ensure that they have a future, yes or no? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government has introduced a comprehensive framework for the strict regulation of the production, distribution, and consumption of cannabis. eos sos we have been working collaboratively with our provincial and territorial partners. eos"
"sos here are the prime minister's pre-end zone instructions to his ministers: 
              
                
                  ... you must uphold the highest standards of honesty and impartiality...and the arrangement of your private affairs should bear the closest public scrutiny. eos sos when are they actually going to live up to those words, or are they just meaningless words written on paper? eos","sos mr. speaker, i can tell the member that our government is committed to living up to the highest standards. eos sos that is why we are working with the ethics commissioner to make sure that in all of our situations, she understands all of our assets. eos"
sos this government said that it would live up to the highest ethical standards. eos sos why then can the government not even enforce the bare minimum? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we will continue to work with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner. eos sos we know that is very important. eos"
"sos i wonder who are the ones making baseless accusations in the house. eos sos my question is simple: now that we know that his finance minister is in a direct conflict of interest, i would like to know why the prime minister misled parliament and all canadians. eos","sos mr. speaker, yesterday, i spoke with a member of the opposition. eos sos he told me that it was not personal, that what happens here in the house is just a game. eos"
sos was the minister of finance actually in conflict of interest? eos sos when did the prime minister know about it? eos,"sos mr. speaker, as we have said, working with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner is very important. eos sos that is what we have done. eos"
sos the minister talks about trusting the ethics commissioner. eos sos is there a senior government official over there who will actually say that there is no other minister in the same position he put himself in? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we know on this side of the house that some of the members of the opposition have a tough time counting. eos sos what we know is that the number two is less than the number five. eos"
sos the hon. eos sos member for milton has the floor. eos,"sos mr. speaker, one thing we can all agree on is that the minister of finance needs help in one thing in counting: he better count on getting some better communications advice. eos sos the prime minister said this week:
              
                
                  ... i am not trying to blame the ethics commissioner, i am trying to trust the ethics commissioner. eos"
sos the hon. eos sos minister of finance. eos,"sos mr. speaker, thinking about counting for the member for milton, there are 25,630 children in her riding whose families are getting on average $520 more through the canada child benefit. eos sos those are the numbers that we know matter to canadians. eos"
sos time. eos,sos order. eos sos i would ask the hon. eos
sos we trust the ethics commissioner. eos sos just how many ministers have gamed the spirit of the conflict of interest act? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i am delighted to hear that members opposite trust the ethics commissioner, as we do. eos sos we have worked with the ethics commissioner to make sure that we can ensure all of our situations are fully exposed and that she can provide recommendations for us on how we can ensure we do not have conflicts of interest. eos"
sos why is the prime minister misleading parliament about other ministers' actions? eos sos is the prime minister's office calling the ethics commissioner a liar? eos,"sos mr. speaker, again, we have the highest respect for the ethics commissioner and will continue to work with her to make sure that her work, which is so important, can continue to be done in a respectful way. eos sos that is our approach. eos"
"sos some hon. eos sos members: hear, hear! eos","sos the house leader of the official opposition has the usual thursday question, following which we have a question of privilege to be raised and then two points of order, including one from her. eos"
"sos when maybe things are tough, insults like thatbimbo, you don't know how to count ,  you're not smart , you're a puppetare hurled at women politicians and at women in general. eos sos i hope that is not what the minister of finance was trying to do, but i would like to give him the opportunity to apologize to our very qualified, very smart, and very capable deputy house leader. eos",sos the hon. eos sos house leader of the official opposition will know that i did address this point at the time. eos
"sos mr. speaker, i would like to ask the government house leader if she could please tell us what business is happening for the rest of this week and next week before we go back for our remembrance day ceremonies. eos","sos mr. speaker, this morning we started second reading debate on bill c-63, the budget implementation act. eos sos we will continue debate on this legislation this afternoon. eos"
"sos they witnessed everything he did and how he intimidated me. eos sos therefore, i reserve the right for a question of privilege with proper notice. eos",sos i want to thank the hon. eos sos member for her intervention. eos
"sos yesterday, the information commissioner said:
              
                
                  ... i went back to the request...that uncovered the sponsorship scandal and that request would not meet their new requirement under [this bill]. eos sos why does the liberal party want to hide other sponsorship scandals? eos","sos mr. speaker, in 2006, the conservatives promised to reform the access to information act. eos sos they did nothing for 10 years. eos"
sos it was the information commissioner who said that. eos sos is the liberal party preparing other sponsorship scandals that it wants to keep under wraps? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we are the first government in 30 years to want to update the access to information act, and we will work with the information commissioner to do so. eos sos [english] in fact, let us be very clear. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, the finance minister has placed the ethics commissioner in an impossible position, first by withholding information from the commissioner, then by claiming that she supported everything he did, but she fined him for not complying with the act. eos sos instead of insulting mps and insinuating that female elected representatives cannot do math, why does the finance minister not just come clean and answer the questions? eos","sos mr. speaker, i would like to say for the record that i hold the ethics commissioner in the highest regard. eos sos we believe that it is important that we have an officer of parliament who helps all of us here in the house to ensure that we can expose our personal assets and do it in a way that allows us to take recommendations on how we can assure that we do not have conflicts of interest. eos"
"sos no insults, please. eos sos what else is the finance minister hiding in his other numbered companies? eos","sos mr. speaker, the answer is nothing. eos sos the answer is that i have exposed all of my assets to the ethics commissioner. eos"
sos the hon. eos sos minister of finance has the floor. eos,"sos mr. speaker, what i can say is that, in fact, my state of mind is not irritated but actually encouraged with the economy that we are seeing for canadians. eos sos we have seen, over two years, a very positive change in our economy. eos"
"sos however, we do not know what holdings he has because he is hiding them in a myriad of numbered companies. eos sos will the finance minister tell us what holdings he is hiding in these numbered companies, so canadians can surmise the small list of taxes that he will not raise? eos","sos mr. speaker, i want to assure my hon. eos sos colleague that the minister of finance has always done what all mps do, by working with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner to make sure he is always fully transparent with her and follows the rules. eos"
"sos it took investigative journalists to find out that he was hiding $20 million of holdings in morneau shepell, a financial company that he regulates, and a financial company on which he very carefully avoided imposing any new taxes. eos sos will the finance minister tell canadians what holdings he is hiding in his numbered companies and trust funds, so they can know that he is acting in their interest and not his own? eos","sos mr. speaker, acting in the interests of canadians was lowering taxes for nine million canadians, lowering taxes for small businesses from 10.5% to 9%, helping 300,000 kids be lifted out of poverty with the canada child benefit, and growing this economy at the fastest pace in the g7, something the conservatives were never able to achieve. eos sos that is working in the interests of canadians. eos"
"sos third, while the liberals raised taxes on everybody else, the finance minister was very meticulous in ensuring that none of the tax increases applied to him or morneau shepell. eos sos once again, will he finally reveal what he is hiding in this vast network of numbered companies and trust funds, so canadians can be assured that their finance minister is acting in the public interest, not for his private profit? eos","sos mr. speaker, the finance minister has always been transparent and forthcoming with the ethics commissioner. eos sos he has always followed the rules and followed the recommendations, and he has announced he will go even above and beyond. eos"
"sos he paid a fine for hiding his villa in france, and now he is casting doubt on the ethics commissioner's word. eos sos instead of being complicit in this sad affair where the rich can cut a fat cheque to get themselves off the hook, will someone in the government stand up and ask the finance minister to tell us what he is hiding in his numbered companies? eos","sos mr. speaker, the minister of finance has always worked with the ethics commissioner and will continue to do so with full transparency to make sure he is following the rules. eos sos he has announced that he will go even further by divesting himself of his shares in morneau shepell and placing all of his assets in a blind trust so he can continue the important work he does for canadians. eos"
sos canadians deserve more transparency from their finance minister. eos sos when will he tell canadians what he is hiding in his numbered companies? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the institution responsible for preserving the integrity of parliament, an institution that we have the utmost faith in and the greatest respect for, is the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner. eos sos the minister of finance has always worked with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner and he continues to work with her to ensure that he continues to act on her recommendations and go even further to have the full confidence of canadians and continue the important work he does for all canadians. eos"
"sos as more and more information is in the cloud, we need to put proper legal protections in place. eos sos will this government commit to imposing severe fines on companies that fail to protect consumers' private information? eos","sos mr. speaker, as the hon. eos sos member knows, privacy is very important to this government, particularly with respect to the digital economy and the fact that we have more data available. eos"
"sos that is exactly what the privacy commissioner is asking when he talks about fining businesses, like equifax, that compromise the privacy of canadians. eos sos will the minister follow up on the privacy commissioner's recommendation and take the necessary steps to actually begin fining large corporations that compromise the privacy of canadians? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government is taking action to protect the privacy of canadians. eos sos as mentioned by the member opposite, equifax recently confirmed a cyber-attack that resulted in a data security breach. eos"
sos that is unacceptable. eos sos will the government at least promise to pay these employees damages and interest retroactively? eos,"sos mr. speaker, of course we have always worked closely with our federal public service union partners. eos sos we respect our federal employees, and we are working to resolve the problems with the phoenix pay system. eos"
"sos also, because of the phoenix delays, the liberals will not meet deadlines to negotiate new collective agreements with our public servants. eos sos when will the liberals stop finding excuses and find a solution to the phoenix boondoggle? eos","sos mr. speaker, of course we take these problems very seriously. eos sos we have invested and taken a vast number of measures to resolve the problems associated with the phoenix pay system. eos"
sos the commissioner's current powers are definitely inadequate. eos sos will the government act on the committee's recommendations for once and strengthen the commissioner's powers? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we thank the committee, including the member for drummond, for the report. eos sos we will give it careful consideration. eos"
"sos this put vulnerable spouses, especially women, at risk of additional abuse and violence. eos sos could the minister update the house on what our government is doing to support newcomer women who are being trapped by this conservative policy? eos","sos mr. speaker, i would like to thank my colleague from auroraoak ridges richmond hill for her question. eos sos [english] our government is deeply committed to gender equality and combatting gender-based violence. eos"
"sos when will the government realize that every time it adds a new regulation, it increases costs and reduces choices? eos sos when is the government going to stop punishing homebuyers? eos","sos mr. speaker, energy efficiency offers a significant opportunity to help realize canada's obligations to address climate change while supporting economic growth and the health of canadians. eos sos we are working with our provincial and territorial partners to develop a model code for existing buildings by 2022. this code, which provinces and territories can adopt, would help guide energy efficiency improvements. eos"

sos this includes projects such as installing an aerator to improve the water quality in killarney lake located in my constituency. eos sos will the liberals commit today to support canada's recreational fishers and start accepting proposals for this very worthwhile program? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i appreciate the opportunity to stand in the house and share with members what we are doing for recreational fishers from coast to coast to coast. eos sos in fact, i met with recreational fishers just this week, and i was able to share with them the fact that we are investing in coastal restoration. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, the recognition of rights, and in particular the inherent right to self-government and the right to self-determination, is fundamental to advancing reconciliation in canada. eos sos could the minister of crown-indigenous relations and northern affairs update the house on the concrete measures canada is taking with its indigenous partners to promote self-determination and facilitate self-government? eos","sos mr. speaker, we know that good governance and self-determination are the most important factors in a community's economic and social health. eos sos this past summer, we signed the agreement on the cree nation governance, a nation-to-nation agreement based on our partnership and respect for the traditional cree way of life. eos"

"sos i have some news for the minister of canadian heritage: contrary to what she seems to think, singling out netflix for a tax break its rivals do not get is a tax policy. eos sos why the preferential treatment? eos","sos mr. speaker, we understand the concerns of the francophone cultural sector. eos sos we want to reassure and remind the cultural community of the historic investments we have made to support francophone culture. eos"
"sos this limits the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner's scope of action. eos sos instead of finding ways to get around the rules, why does the prime minister not agree to strengthen the legislation? eos","sos mr. speaker, as i have said many times before, the minister of finance has the utmost respect for the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner. eos sos he has always worked with her with the greatest transparency since he took office. eos"

sos now we learn that canadians and canadian taxpayers will be sending a half a billion dollars to china for infrastructure projects everywhere else in the world except canada. eos sos why are the liberals borrowing more money to send to china instead of building roads and bridges in canada? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we are proud to have approved more than 4,000 projects since taking office, with a combined investment of more than $35 billion. eos sos federal investments are enabling these projects to move forward. eos"
sos the cbsa has investigated this case for five years and recommends that charges be laid. eos sos why has the government not acted on the recommendations of the cbsa? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we have taken concrete to steps to correct the temporary foreign workers program. eos sos part of that is strengthening the lmias, the labour market impact assessments, that ensure employers are doing a thorough job of hiring canadians first and then proving the need for temporary foreign workers. eos"
"sos therefore, we call upon you, speaker, to exercise the powers vested in you in the standing orders to uphold the principle of no taxation without representation. eos sos that is, canadians must have the ability to rely on parliament to approve every expenditure that the government taxes fund, independently and separately from other matters, and to instill a sense of integrity in the budget process so that all canadians can have confidence in how their money is spent. eos",sos i want to thank the hon. eos sos member for his intervention. eos

sos let us see what he will do now that some of the liberals' closest advisers were named in the paradise papers and they are the ones who allegedly used loopholes to shelter their fortunes. eos sos how long has the prime minister known that liberal bagman stephen bronfman avoids paying all of his taxes in canada? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we are fully committed to combatting tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. eos sos i will let the individuals concerned comment on their own situation, but i will say that the canada revenue agency is reviewing links to canadian entities and will take every appropriate action with respect to the paradise papers. eos"

sos we are on track to recuperate $25 billion from our efforts against tax avoidance and tax evasion. eos sos we will continue to work for a system that is fair. eos,"sos mr. speaker, over the past two years the current liberal government has demonized retail workers who enjoy an employee discount. eos sos it has demonized hard-working entrepreneurs and business owners, and characterized them as tax cheats. eos"
sos we made it cheaper and more affordable for young people to go to school. eos sos that is what we have been doing. eos,"sos mr. speaker, the stats that prime minister is quoting actually shows his government is doing a good job going after the small taxpayer, going after ordinary canadians, but it always lets the big fish go. eos sos we know about stephen bronfman through the paradise papers, but let us not forget that the government, through committee, stalled the study on kpmg and the isle of man. eos"
"sos we use the information received through leaked lists when they arise, but we do not wait on these lists to attack the problem. eos sos that is why the cra has more than 990 audits and more than 42 criminal investigations related to offshore financial structures, under way as of september 30. eos","sos mr. speaker, the government is going after the small taxpayer, but not the big fish. eos sos the prime minister was elected on the promise to work hard for the middle class and those working hard to join it. eos"
"sos there are 627 cases transferred to criminal investigations, 268 search warrants executed, 78 convictions. eos sos we will continue to work hard every day for a tax system that is fair for everyone. eos","sos mr. speaker, hiring more inspectors without changing the current treaties with tax havens will not amount to much. eos sos an international consortium of journalists published a list of new names of people who are benefiting from tax havens: the queen of england, rock stars, trump's entourage, and, in canada, the liberals. eos"
"sos the results speak for themselves: 627 cases have been transferred to criminal investigation, and there have been 268 warrants and 78 convictions. eos sos we will continue to work hard every day to create a tax system that is fair for all canadians. eos","sos mr. speaker, the cayman islands is the kind of place where there are more bank accounts than people. eos sos members of the middle class and those working hard to join it do not have bank accounts in the cayman islands. eos"
sos that is why we are in the process of lowering the small business tax rate to 9%. eos sos that is what we are doing for the middle class. eos,"sos mr. speaker, meanwhile, with his tax reform, the prime minister spent weeks essentially accusing our farmers, entrepreneurs, and professionals of fraud. eos sos the paradise papers scandal is proof of the liberals' hypocrisy. eos"
"sos we have transferred 627 cases to criminal investigation, and there have been 268 search warrants and 78 convictions. eos sos the canada revenue agency is scrutinizing links to canadian entities, and we will take appropriate action. eos","sos mr. speaker, they could speed things along if the minister asked the prime minister for his friends' phone numbers. eos sos members of the prime minister's inner circle are using all kinds of schemes to hide millions of dollars in tax havens. eos"
"sos canadians expect a fair tax system. eos sos that is what we promised, and that is what we will deliver. eos","sos mr. speaker, with the liberals it is always the same, you scratch my back and i'll scratch yours. eos sos stephen bronfman said to the prime minister, anything i can do to help, just let me know. eos"
"sos our strategies and measures are yielding results. eos sos i want to reassure the public that the canada revenue agency is reviewing links to canadian entities, and we will take appropriate action. eos","sos mr. speaker, when bronfman said that the goal was to raise a lot of money to help this guy become the next prime minister, he was not doing it as an act of charity. eos sos he, as all liberals do, always wants something in return. eos"
"sos co-operation between revenue authorities, including the exchange of tax information, is an essential tool for maintaining the integrity of canada's tax base. eos sos our efforts have borne fruit, as we are about to recoup $25billion. eos","sos mr. speaker, stephen bronfman is the prime minister's top moneyman, and was the liberal party's revenue chair. eos sos the prime minister vacations with him. eos"
"sos we have had 627cases transferred to criminal investigations, 268search warrants executed, and 78convictions. eos sos we continue to work for canadians. eos","sos mr. speaker, the liberals have spent another billion dollars on tax collectors. eos sos who have those tax collectors gone after? eos"
"sos we are giving a record number of tax credits to people with disabilities and people with mental health problems. eos sos in budget 2017, we invested $5billion so we could help 500,000canadians under the age of 25, and we will continue to focus on helping those most in need. eos","sos mr. speaker, the government does not understand anything about international tax avoidance because it continues to ignore the fundamental problem of tax havens instead of addressing it. eos sos the minister still believes that the solution to tax havens is to invest in the canada revenue agency. eos"
sos we are on track to meet canadians' expectations. eos sos it is what we promised in our platform and we are keeping that promise. eos,"sos mr. speaker, it did not take long for the liberals to start acting like liberals, placing wealthy friends ahead of everyday canadians. eos sos in march of this year, the liberals voted in favour of the ndp's motion calling on the government to take action to tackle tax haven, including renegotiating tax treaties that let companies repatriate profits from tax havens to canada tax free. eos"
sos we are working with tax administrations around the world. eos sos i can say that i am very proud of the international leadership role we have taken. eos,"sos mr. speaker, a major ethics crisis involving the prime minister of canada is tarnishing canada's international reputation. eos sos we now know that stephen bronfman, the liberal party's chief fundraiser, had questionable dealings with tax havens. eos"
"sos we are working with our partners around the world. eos sos that is what canadians asked us to do, and that is what we are going to do. eos","sos mr. speaker, as everyone knows, the prime minister is very close to the bronfman family and to stephenbronfman in particular. eos sos this reflects poorly on canada. eos"
sos the hon. eos sos minister of national revenue. eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government is fully committed to combatting tax evasion. eos sos i do not understand my colleagues across the way. eos"
"sos canadian taxpayers paid for that trip. eos sos we ask the government again, what business did bronfman have at the white house? eos","sos mr. speaker, in our first two budgets, we invested nearly $1billion, a historic amount, to combat tax evasion and tax avoidance. eos sos our plan is working. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, a liberal is liberal is a liberal, and we can always count on them to be entitled to their entitlements, entitled to take private helicopters on private island vacations, entitled to taxpayer-funded nannies, entitled to protecting their vast family fortunes from many unfair tax changes, entitled to setting up offshore tax havens in france, barbados, or the cayman islands. eos sos canadians are entitled to know, why do they always end up footing the bill when these lifestyle of the rich and famous liberals pay less? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government is committed to combatting tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. eos sos i want to reassure canadians that, personally, as the minister responsible for the canada revenue agency, i have no one to protect. eos"
"sos workers fulfill their obligations, and companies and the liberal government must do the same. eos sos will the prime minister keep his promise and work with me to protect our pensioners, yes or no? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government supports secure pensions. eos sos more importantly, we understand workers and their families and the dedication and commitment they make to various companies. eos"
"sos they know that the smart investments our government is making will help more canadians find and keep good, well-paying jobs. eos sos can the minister update this house on what our government is doing to grow the economy and ensure every canadian has a fair shot at success? eos","sos mr. speaker, the investments we are making in child care, skilled trades, training, and infrastructure will put more canadians on the path to success. eos sos since our government first took office, the canadian economy has created over half a million jobs. eos"
"sos canadians want to see a properly funded redress system in the 2018 federal budget, and they want an end to the hundreds, if not thousands, of false positives that have occurred to date. eos sos when will the government finally heed these calls and end this injustice for families once and for all? eos","sos mr. speaker, we fully appreciate the frustration of law-abiding travellers who can be stigmatized and delayed as a result of false positives on the no-fly list. eos sos however, to be clear, there are no children on the no-fly list, but there is confusion among similar names. eos"
"sos they are being humiliated, profiled, and are living in fear of ending up on the no-fly list. eos sos again i ask the minister: will she fully fund an actual redress system, yes or no? eos","sos mr. speaker, the problem is that the no-fly list that was designed 10 years ago contains an inherent design flaw that needs to be fixed. eos sos to fix it takes legislation and regulation and a new computer system built from the bottom up. eos"
"sos now, we thought the finance minister was just protecting his own interests within his family company, but it turns out that there is actually a whole crew of liberals who are colluding together in order to keep these tax loopholes open. eos sos my question is very simple, and that is: when did the prime minister become aware that the liberal party's head of revenue, stephen bronfman, was sheltering money in offshore accounts? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government is fully committed to combatting tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. eos sos in the last two budgets, we invested nearly $1 billion, and our plan is working. eos"
sos it seems that the babies the minister was referring to are a bunch of the prime minister's friends and liberal party donors. eos sos when will the prime minister quit attacking farmers and small business owners and start investigating liberal party donors who are using offshore tax havens? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government is fully committed to fighting tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. eos sos i am proud of the leadership role canada has taken on the international stage. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, middle-class canadians continue to hear the prime minister demand tax fairness from them, but when it comes to liberal party donors and wealthy insiders, the prime minister practises instead tax forgiveness. eos sos when will the prime minister end his two-tier taxation policy and start making liberal insiders and donors pay their fair share of liberal spending, rather than going after hard-working canadian small business owners and farmers? eos","sos mr. speaker, as minister of national revenue, i can say that there will be no double standard. eos sos everyone must obey the law. eos"
"sos the mayor is adding her voice to that of the federation of canadian municipalities' big city mayors' caucus, which recently called on the government to ensure that the national housing strategy includes funding to maintain and expand the social housing stock. eos sos has the minister heard her call? eos","sos mr. speaker, i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate ms. plante on being elected montreal's new mayor. eos sos i also want to congratulate and thank all of the other candidates who worked very hard all across quebec to run in the municipal election. eos"
"sos recently, the minister of canadian heritage made historic announcements for canadian creators. eos sos could the minister tell the house what she is doing to support these artists and to showcase their work abroad? eos","sos mr. speaker, i want to thank my colleague for his excellent question and for his work in the cultural sector. eos sos we believe in culture. eos"
"sos it is clear the liberals misled families when they promised they were doing everything they could to help this inquiry succeed. eos sos will the liberals support the families of missing and murdered indigenous women, and when will they stop blocking the inquiry's work? eos","sos mr. speaker, the important work of the commission is crucial to getting the answers the families have been waiting decades for, and to ending this ongoing tragedy. eos sos we are absolutely committed to ensuring that the commission has all the support it needs to succeed. eos"
sos the liberals are proposing to undermine the intent of this law even further by making canadians wait six years for reports of injuries and deaths and by requiring researchers to sign contracts to never reveal crucial data. eos sos why has the government abandoned vanessa's law and the transparency crucial to reducing drug harm and deaths? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we remain committed to working with our provincial and territorial partners to ensure that all canadians have access to the prescription drugs they require in an affordable and accessible way. eos sos we will continue to work with all affected canadians on ensuring that this system is fair for all. eos"
"sos taxes are for other people to pay, certainly not the prime minister's friends. eos sos will the canada revenue agency do its job and investigate stephen bronfman? eos","sos mr. speaker, during the last campaign, the government was very clear. eos sos cracking down on tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance was part of our platform. eos"
"sos the liberal party is the tax-evasion party, and yet the liberals still claim to be standing up for the middle class. eos sos will this government finally take action and go after people who use tax havens to evade taxes, even if those people include friends, family members, or colleagues? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government is fully committed to combatting tax evasion, and we have taken concrete action to do so. eos sos over the past two years, we have invested nearly $1billion, allowing us to recoup $25billion. eos"
sos this is 50% lower than the national average. eos sos how and when will similar targeted investments be made for inuit education in nunavut? eos,"sos mr. speaker, in line with our commitment to work with provinces and territories, we recognize that the issues raised by my colleague are very important. eos sos i can assure him that they are at the very heart of our preoccupations. eos"
"sos it has even become a leading city, and a lot of work has gone into its development, but there is, of course, always more to be done. eos sos [english] any democracy worthy of its name is always a work in progress, and it is our duty as parliamentarians to build on the foundation laid by those first members of parliament who established the country that it is our privilege to serve. eos","sos mr. speaker, prime ministers, i rise today to mark a historic anniversary. eos sos on this day 150years ago, canada's first legislature sat for the very first time. eos"

"sos our government has made great steps on this, which can be seen in the significant drop in the number of people detained under immigration laws in the last two years. eos sos can the minister please tell us what more the government is doing to ensure that immigration detention, especially for minors, is used as rarely as possible? eos","sos mr. speaker, we are working very hard to improve the immigration detention system. eos sos i thank the member for toronto danforth for being such a strong advocate. eos"
"sos however, when the minister of finance and the liberal bagman try to hide their assets or avoid paying taxes, all we get from the prime minister is radio silence. eos sos how long has the prime minister known that his chief fundraiser stashes money in tax havens? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government is fully committed to fighting tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. eos sos in our last two budgets, we invested nearly $1billion to crack down on tax cheats. eos"
"sos the bronfmans are also known for being very effective at lobbying against closing offshore tax loopholes. eos sos when did the prime minister learn that his friend and chief fundraiser had these offshore holdings, and that his lawyers had lobbied so hard to protect these tax havens? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government knows that billions of dollars are at stake. eos sos we made an historic investment of nearly $1billion in the canada revenue agency to combat this problem. eos"
"sos it is almost as if there is one set of rules for the prime minister and his wealthy friends, and another set of rules for everybody else. eos sos why is it that every time the prime minister makes changes, it always benefits those in the jet-set life, and it always makes life harder for those in the road-trip life? eos","sos mr. speaker, i find it rather odd to hear conservative members say that we are not working on closing tax loopholes when for 10 years their government did nothing about tax evasion. eos sos a former national revenue minister, jean-pierre blackburn, even said so publicly. eos"
sos the hon. eos sos member for richmondarthabaska. eos,"sos mr. speaker, while the prime minister claims that he is making the wealthiest 1% pay, he is paying his christmas holiday with taxpayers' money, off-loading the deficit to the middle class, and attacking job creators across the country. eos sos he is being hypocritical to the point of turning a blind eye to the paradise papers scandal. eos"
"sos collaboration between tax administrations, including the exchange of tax information, is an essential tool to protect the integrity of canada's tax base. eos sos that is why, as of september 30, 2017, the canada revenue agency had more than 990 audits and 42 criminal investigations under way focusing on offshore financial structures. eos","sos mr. speaker, i was just about to mention the minister's department. eos sos today, we learned that the canada revenue agency is deliberately failing to disclose how much money is lost to tax evasion each year. eos"
"sos last year, the cra imposed $44million in penalties on proponents and tax advisers. eos sos we are continuing the work that we promised canadians we would do during the election campaign. eos","sos mr. speaker, yesterday, the prime minister told us that the cra would be looking into allegations of tax evasion, but he stopped short of confirming that this would be the case for stephen bronfman. eos sos this is the same cra that is constantly under fire by tax experts for going hard against everyday canadians, but for throwing back the big fish. eos"

"sos when i talk about the 627 cases that have been transferred to criminal investigations, the 268 search warrants, and the 78 convictions, i am not sure what the member opposite does not understand. eos sos that is what it means to take action and get the job done. eos","sos mr. speaker, instead of relying on meaningless stats, she should understand one thing. eos sos we are lawmakers. eos"
"sos there have been charges, criminal investigations, and warrants. eos sos we continue to work for canadians and for a fair tax system. eos","sos mr. speaker, the prime minister and the finance minister took great pains this summer explaining that hard-working fishers, farmers, and small business owners were really not paying their fair share and were in fact tax cheats, all the while we had the liberal bagman and the prime minister's close friends stashing $60 million away in the cayman islands tax scheme. eos sos my question is very simple. eos"
"sos we are working on this file, unlike the conservatives who, for 10 years and even according to one of their own former revenue ministers, did nothing. eos sos it was not even a priority for their government. eos","sos mr. speaker, i am going to use some numbers, so that the government understands the hypocrisy of what it is talking about. eos sos as i said, a liberal bagman stashed $60 million away in a tax-free account in the cayman islands. eos"

sos we do not know if this is a real promise or if it is yet another promise that the government intends to break. eos sos how does this government expect to win a seat on the security council when it does not fulfill its commitments? eos,"sos mr. speaker, making sure canada is once again involved in peacekeeping operations is important to our government. eos sos our troops are highly qualified and well trained. eos"
"sos this prime minister is the one who is causing so much confusion and raising taxes for small businesses and middle-class families. eos sos why then, when canadians are looking for answers, does the prime minister respond with nothing more than a busy signal? eos","sos mr. speaker, i know that we are going to have a great discussion today about the auditor general's report. eos sos it is an excellent report that will be very helpful for our government in improving services. eos"
"sos canadians who need advice on their tax situation are blocked, get a busy signal, are told to call back, or are disconnected, but when his friend, stephen bronfman, needed an answer on his tax situation, the prime minister answered the call pretty darn quick and gave him the answer that he was looking for. eos sos why is it that liberal friends get their calls answered and the answers they want and ordinary canadians have to be put on hold? eos","sos mr. speaker, today we are going to be talking about the auditor general's report, as we should. eos sos it is an excellent report and, actually, a very helpful report. eos"
"sos from the beginning of the session, the minister has repeated that he has always worked with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner and, oddly enough, today we read in the globe and mail that the minister never worked with the commissioner on his bill c-27. eos sos can the prime minister tell us why canadians would still trust the minister of finance? eos","sos mr. speaker, what is expected of all parliamentarians in the house is that they work with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner. eos sos the minister of finance did so as soon as he took office. eos"
"sos what does the government have to say about the level of integrity he has shown over the past two years? eos sos will the prime minister finally admit what all canadians know, that his finance minister has been in a direct conflict of interest for the past two years? eos","sos mr. speaker, what all canadians know is that, in this place, the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner is responsible for safeguarding the integrity of parliament. eos sos like us, canadians expect all parliamentarians to work with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner and follow her recommendations. eos"
"sos the prime minister and the finance minister and his staff all claim he has been working with the ethics commissioner from the start, but now, the prime minister and two of his cabinet ministers are under investigation by the ethics commissioner. eos sos how can canadians trust the prime minister? eos","sos mr. speaker, what is expected of all parliamentarians is to work with the ethics commissioner, who is responsible to safeguard the integrity of this parliament. eos sos the finance minister has always worked in full transparency with the ethics commissioner, has always followed her recommendations, will continue to do so, and of his own accord has decided to go above and beyond, divesting all his shares in morneau shepell, and placing all of his assets in a blind trust so that he can continue to do the important work and avoid any further distraction. eos"
sos the hon. eos sos member for lakeland. eos,"sos mr. speaker, canadians expect the prime minister to safeguard integrity, but the prime minister is the first canadian prime minister under investigation by the ethics commissioner; and the finance minister is being investigated for using his public powers to enrich himself and his family. eos sos he claims he worked with the ethics commissioner and that there was a so-called ethical screen in place, but apparently she was not aware they were working together because now she is investigating him for it, and obviously that screen was a wide-open window. eos"
sos the hon. eos sos parliamentary secretary. eos,"sos mr. speaker, that conflict of interest screen that was put in place following the recommendation of the ethics commissioner, which she deemed to be the best measure of compliance, was a measure that was good enough for the member for milton and for denis lebel when they were in office. eos sos the finance minister has always worked with the ethics commissioner and will always work with the ethics commissioner. eos"
sos his company had designed new brunswick's system of targeted benefit pension plans. eos sos is there anything about his bill that was not previously written by his own company? eos,"sos mr. speaker, as i have mentioned time and time again, the finance minister has always worked with the ethics commissioner in full transparency, disclosing all of his assets and following her recommendation, the path she set forward. eos sos on this side of the house, we respect the ethics commissioner's work, and we follow her recommendations to make sure that all rules are followed. eos"
sos there are numerous tax benefits people can get for donating to charity. eos sos which one will the finance minister use? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the minister of finance introduced billc-27 to ensure that canadians have a secure and stable retirement, so that they may live out their retirement with dignity. eos sos the minister of finance has always worked with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner. eos"
sos is that the liberals' approach to governing? eos sos they do nothing about tax havens and introduce bills to get richer and to make their millionaire friends richer? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i am very pleased to have the chance to contrast our track record with that of my colleague opposite. eos sos our government is fully committed to fighting tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. eos"
"sos then after being elected and still owning and controlling millions of dollars of shares in morneau shepell, he sponsors a bill that would benefit morneau shepell and himself personally. eos sos if this does not qualify as a conflict of interest in the heart and mind of the prime minister, then what does? eos","sos mr. speaker, when the minister answered the call to public service, he did what is expected of every minister and parliamentarian. eos sos he sat down with the ethics commissioner and followed the recommendations she made based on his situation. eos"
sos how can the minister think that he is not in conflict of interest when he makes the laws that govern a business in which he holds shares? eos sos how can the minister of finance say that he is not in conflict of interest? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the minister of finance is working with the ethics commissioner, who is responsible for determining if there is conflict of interest, and that is what he has always done. eos sos upon arriving in ottawa, he did what is expected of all parliamentarians. eos"
sos he was in conflict of interest. eos sos why does the prime minister continue to protect the minister of finance? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i think that the hon. eos sos member for beauce knows how the house works, as well as the institutions that protect the integrity of the house. eos"
"sos we know that was not true and she never signed off on that blatant conflict of interest. eos sos why should canadians trust the finance minister, when he is under investigation yet again for misleading canadians and breaking the rules? eos","sos mr. speaker, i believe that canadians can trust that the ethics commissioner will do her job, will guide parliamentarians, and will ensure that the rules are obeyed in order to avoid any conflict of interest, real or perceived. eos sos the minister has always worked with the ethics commissioner from the very beginning. eos"
sos he is under investigation yet again. eos sos why should canadians trust anything he says? eos,"sos mr. speaker, this member wants to talk about what the minister of finance is doing for canadians. eos sos we can talk about that. eos"
sos how is it that we are still in this situation in 2017? eos sos when will the government finally assume its responsibilities and lift all children out of poverty? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i want to thank and congratulate my colleague on her question. eos sos i wish to remind my colleague that our government takes poverty among families and children very seriously. eos"
"sos if the liberals are really serious about addressing child poverty, they need an action plan that includes concrete targets and a timeline to meet them. eos sos if two whole years in office were not enough for the government to act, can the liberals tell us how much longer they are going to ask these children to wait? eos","sos mr. speaker, i would like to thank my colleague for asking this very relevant question. eos sos this government is the first government that will put in place a poverty reduction strategy. eos"
"sos this is a major issue in rural canada, where computer and telecommunications systems do not meet basic standards and access to broadband is limited or even non-existent. eos sos i am happy to have the opportunity to ask my colleague, the minister of innovation, science and economic development, how the connect to innovate program will provide canadians with better internet access. eos","sos mr. speaker, i would like to once again welcome my colleague from lac-saint-jean. eos sos high-speed internet is not a luxury. eos"
sos this legislation enables the exact product that his family's company specializes in and for which the finance minister himself lobbied for before he entered politics. eos sos did the prime minister ever request assurances from the finance minister that he was working with the ethics commissioner before introducing the legislation? eos,"sos mr. speaker, all members of this house work with the ethics commissioner to ensure that their personal finances, their personal interests are in line with the expectations that canadians have of all members of this house to live up to the high expectations of citizens. eos sos all of us, including the finance minister, work with the ethics commissioner and listen to and follow her counsel. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, just yesterday, the prime minister said that the minister of finance had always worked closely with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner. eos sos therefore, i am asking him one more time: did the prime minister verify with the minister of finance that the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner had allowed him to introduce his pension legislation, bill c-27? eos","sos mr. speaker, mps on both sides of the house often engage in attacks that are sometimes personal and sometimes based on facts. eos sos that is how democracy works. eos"
sos which is it? eos sos did anyone ever tell the prime minister that his finance minister was clear to table bill c-27 before the bill was introduced in parliament? eos,"sos mr. speaker, every member of this house, when they arrive to serve, works with the ethics commissioner to ensure that their personal situation, their financial situation, is in order and aligned with the high expectations that canadians have of each of us in this house. eos sos the minister of finance worked with the ethics commissioner to ensure that the decisions he would take, whether it was putting in a screen or whether it was various personal dispositions, would ensure that canadians could have confidence that everyone in this house is following the rules. eos"
"sos we know that some have returned to canada, that some are planning to return, and that some did not have permission to travel abroad to fight because they were known to have hostile intentions. eos sos can the minister finally give us the correct figures and show some transparency? eos","sos mr. speaker, i did give the member the numbers yesterday. eos sos i would also inform him that, in the usual course, we publish an annual report on the threat assessment with respect to canada. eos"
sos how can he tell canadians their safety is not being jeopardized? eos sos can he at least assure us that these people are under round-the-clock surveillance? eos,"sos mr. speaker, as i indicated yesterday, the number is approximately 60. that is exactly the same number as under the previous government, of which the hon. eos sos gentleman is a defender. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, my colleague opposite did not answer my colleague's question, so i will give him another chance. eos sos of the number of people who have been identified as fighting for isis and have returned to canada, how many of those persons are under 24-hour surveillance? eos","sos mr. speaker, the hon. eos sos member, i am sure, would not want me to engage in operational discussions on the floor of the house of commons that could in fact disclose the security posture of the government of canada. eos"
"sos we know that these people have fought for a group that has beheaded people, burned allied soldiers, raped women, and indeed carried out terrorist attacks on countries around the world, including canada. eos sos why is every single one of these people not under 24-hour surveillance? eos","sos mr. speaker, the police of this country, particularly the rcmp, but also in collaboration with all other police forces in canada, and the cbsa at the border, and csis, our intelligence service, do the monitoring to make sure that every threat to the national security of canada is properly monitored, surveilled, and investigated, and that when evidence is found of any offence, charges are laid. eos"
"sos the government should have seen that coming, but it did not. eos sos since we know something similar is likely to happen again in the coming months, will the government do what it should have done in the first place and suspend the safe third country agreement? eos","sos mr. speaker, canada will always be an open and welcoming country for people seeking refuge. eos sos our government will nevertheless ensure an orderly immigration process. eos"
sos the un committee on the elimination of racial discrimination's most recent report called on canada to at least temporarily suspend the safe third country agreement. eos sos will the government do just that? eos,"sos mr. speaker, as i just said, we have always maintained that anyone who crosses irregularly into canada will not have guaranteed status in canada. eos sos we are intensifying our efforts to raise awareness among people likely to have their temporary protection in the united states taken away, to make sure that they are familiar with canada's immigration laws. eos"
"sos she rejects 80% of vulnerable diabetics, but goes after 0% of wealthy liberal friends hiding money offshore. eos sos when will the revenue minister focus efforts on real tax cheats instead of targeting the vulnerable? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government is committed to ensuring that all canadians receive the credits and benefits to which they are entitled. eos sos i want to reiterate for my colleague opposite that the eligibility requirements for this tax credit have not changed. eos"
"sos the reason provided was that his illness does not affect him 90% of the time. eos sos why is this government counting the seconds when persons with disabilities are affected, but not the billions of dollars that the prime minister's friends are hiding in tax havens? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government is committed to ensuring that all canadians receive the benefits and credits to which they are entitled. eos sos we are introducing national legislation on persons with disabilities that will eliminate the obstacles by focusing on accessibility for all canadians living with a disability. eos"
sos he cuts their pay. eos sos when will the liberal government reverse this cold-hearted policy and actually start to support our injured troops and give back the money they deserve? eos,"sos mr. speaker, through our defence policy, our government is committed to providing unprecedented support to our people and their families. eos sos this government is committed to ensuring that our military members receive their fair compensation for their service to their country. eos"
sos climate science in the canadian arctic plays an important role globally in monitoring the effects of climate change. eos sos can the minister of science please update this house as to how we are supporting this important research? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government understands the importance of arctic science as we address the challenges of climate change in the north. eos sos recently, i joined the minister of environment and climate change to announce $1.6 million to continue the operations and research at this unique facility that monitors the changes we are seeing in the arctic atmosphere and the environment. eos"
"sos does the minister of transport believe in passenger rail? eos sos if so, when will he take action and reinvest in via rail? eos","sos mr. speaker, of course we are committed to passenger rail. eos sos that is why, in the 2016 budget, we allocated $7.7million to look at replacing via rail's fleet. eos"
sos the minister of transport went to paris in september and to seoul last week on behalf of the federal government to support keeping the world anti-doping agency's headquarters in montreal. eos sos montrealers are proud that their city has been home to the agency's headquarters since 2001. can the minister tell my constituents and all montrealers about the work our governments are doing to keep the agency's headquarters in montreal? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i would be happy to. eos sos i thank my colleague from dorvallachinelasalle for her excellent question. eos"
sos it is frankly irresponsible to forge ahead blindly when no one is ready. eos sos can the prime minister explain just why legalizing pot is so urgent? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i am pleased to stand up to speak to bill c-45, which is currently being debated. eos sos our government has been and will always be committed to moving forward to legalize, strictly regulate, and restrict access to cannabis in order to keep it out of the hands of children and the proceeds out of the hands of criminals. eos"
"sos did the prime minister trade away supply management to make up for his insulting attitude towards the leaders of the 10 other tpp partners? eos sos dairy, egg, and poultry producers want answers, not excuses. eos","sos mr. speaker, this side of the house supports dairy, egg, and poultry producers and supply management. eos sos we have always been very clear and have said all along that we will continue to support our farmers and their families, as well as canada's agricultural interests. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, will the prime minister join me in condemning the egregious crackdown on free speech at wilfrid laurier university? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government is committed to creating open spaces for canadians to debate and express their views. eos sos in a free society, we may disagree with someone's views, but we must defend their right to hold them, unless those views promote hate. eos"
"sos first, there were his undeclared shares, then his villa in france, and now, we have the bill he created, billc-27, from which his own family and his company, morneau shepell, directly benefit. eos sos will the prime minister step up and order his minister of finance to show some transparency and disclose all of his assets? eos","sos mr. speaker, i know why the opposition members want to talk about me. eos sos they do not want to talk about our economy and our canadian housing strategy. eos"
"sos my question is simple and perfectly valid, especially considering that we know this minister has been in a direct conflict of interest for the past two years. eos sos if he has nothing to hide, will the minister of finance be honest and disclose, once and for all, his assets, companies, shares, and everything he is hiding from canadians? eos","sos mr. speaker, the reality is that nine out of 10 families are better off since we introduced the canada child benefit. eos sos thanks to this very important benefit, families are now receiving an average of $2,300 more to help improve their situation. eos"
"sos not only has it not yet carried out an analysis of existing measures to see whether and how they are working, but also many of its measures are poorly designed. eos sos if fighting poverty is so important to the government, when will it launch a comprehensive anti-poverty strategy? eos","sos mr. speaker, that is a very good question. eos sos our first step was to introduce a strategy to reduce poverty in our country. eos"
"sos the minister of finance still controls many numbered companies we know nothing about. eos sos when will the prime minister order the minister of finance to disclose all the shares he bought, sold, or held in all of these private companies or trust funds since he was elected? eos","sos mr. speaker, on behalf of everyone in this house, i would like to start by wishing you a happy birthday. eos sos [members sang happy birthday]

"sos now we learn from the auditor general that her department does not just reject half the calls it receives but of those that actually make it through, 30% of canadians get the wrong information. eos sos if the minister wants to win back just a little bit of credibility, will she make this promise today that no canadian will face a fine or penalty if they followed the bad advice of her agency? eos","sos mr. speaker, what i can promise is that we have been working hard on this for the past two years. eos sos i agree with all of the auditor general's recommendations. eos"
"sos here is a simple question. eos sos are these murderers under 24-hour surveillance, yes or no? eos","sos mr. speaker, i am very glad to have the hon. eos sos member's opinion, but i am even more glad to have the rcmp, csis, and cbsa among the best security intelligence and law enforcement expertise in the world. eos"

"sos the isis terrorist, on the other hand, also comes back to canada, but is offered taxpayer-funded reintegration training by the liberals. eos sos why is the prime minister cutting the pay for our injured troops while funding support services for isis terrorists? eos","sos mr. speaker, the only cutting of the canadian armed forces that was done was by the previous government of billions of dollars. eos sos under our new defence policy, we are investing in our people. eos"
sos the prime minister has created so much uncertainty and confusion. eos sos when will the prime minister finally end all of this confusion and just stop attacking local businesses? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i am very pleased to talk about what we are trying to do on behalf of all canadians. eos sos we know that having a tax system that is fair matters to canadians. eos"
sos the liberals have broken their promise to families to do everything in their power to help this vital inquiry succeed. eos sos when will the liberals finally put words into action and bring this national tragedy to an end? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government is committed to ending this ongoing national tragedy, and to ensuring that the commission has all the support it needs to succeed. eos sos we have heard, and take very seriously, the concerns raised about how existing government policy and processes were impeding the work. eos"
"sos in august, canada did not really release a detailed plan, but the minister gave a speech with considerable detail on the war of 1812. today, scotiabank is predicting the failure of nafta. eos sos when will the minister step away from the dinner parties and her progressive talking points and start fighting for the two million jobs that rely on nafta? eos","sos mr. speaker, let me assure the member opposite and all canadians that at the nafta negotiating table we are fighting very hard, and in a very smart, fact-based way, for the canadian national interest. eos sos we made good progress on some of the technical chapters in the mexico round. eos"
sos we also know that we have to be innovative. eos sos i would like to ask the minister of infrastructure and communities to update this house on the progress of the canada infrastructure bank and its leadership team. eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government is focused on investing in public infrastructure to create long-term economic growth and build strong, sustainable, and inclusive communities. eos sos we have appointed 10 outstanding canadians to the board of the infrastructure bank. eos"
"sos our foreign affairs minister has said that this looks...like ethnic cleansing . eos sos with this kind of international consensus, when is the government going to do something substantive to hold the myanmar regime responsible for these horrendous atrocities? eos","sos mr. speaker, i want to thank the member opposite for raising this very grave issue. eos sos this absolutely is ethnic cleansing, and the responsibility falls squarely on myanmar's military leadership and civilian government. eos"
"sos however, we are heartened by the tireless work of the minister of transport, who is clearly making rail safety his number one priority. eos sos could the minister tell us about some of the measures he has taken to improve rail safety in quebec? eos","sos mr. speaker, i want to thank my colleague from alfredpellan for his excellent question and for the work he does on the standing committee on transport, infrastructure and communities. eos sos rail safety is indeed my number one priority. eos"
sos convicted murderers who re-victimize families by withholding the whereabouts of their victims' remains should not be eligible for parole. eos sos will the minister of justice do the right thing and pass legislation that will fix our broken parole system to ensure closure for families like the mccanns? eos,"sos mr. speaker, first of all, i welcome the hon. eos sos gentleman to the house and congratulate him upon his recent election. eos"
sos why is the liberal government boycotting the best shipyard in north america? eos sos why is it determined to put the davie shipyard's top skilled workers out of a job? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the canadian coast guard's icebreaking services are essential for keeping our waters safe, protecting our shoreline economy, and strengthening our economy. eos sos we are working hard to ensure the continuity of these services, and the interim icebreaking services will supplement the program. eos"
"sos by helping reduce greenhouse gases and improving environmental outcomes, we have committed to smart, sustainable management of our natural resources. eos sos could the minister update the house on the importance of the clean growth program and promoting clean technologies? eos","sos mr. speaker, i would like to thank the member for yukon for his boundless optimism and his dedication to advancing sustainable development in our northern communities. eos sos canada's clean growth economy starts with a sustainable and competitive resources sector. eos"
sos the liberals promised higher ethical standards. eos sos why can they not even enforce the bare minimum? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we are seeing both parties in the opposition continuing to focus on me, and we understand why. eos sos what is hard to understand about the opposition member who just spoke is why he is not interested in talking about housing on a day when we are talking about historic changes in housing. eos"
"sos the minister of finance has already been fined for not being in compliance with the ethics act. eos sos given that the minister was found not to be in compliance with it, what is the prime minister going to do to ensure that his directive is enforced? eos","sos mr. speaker, again, the opposition in this case is likely focusing on personal attacks because the members do not want us to focus on what they did not do in housing for the last decade. eos sos what we are going to announce today is how we are going to help 500,000 canadians have more money in their pocket for housing, or a key to a house. eos"
"sos the mandate tracker says: you must uphold the highest standards of honesty and impartiality, and both the performance of your official duties and the arrangement of your private affairs should bear the closest public scrutiny. eos sos is anyone able to trust the minister when we know that in his personal affairs, he has broken it? eos","sos mr. speaker, as i have continued to say, i have followed all the rules. eos sos what i want to do is make sure that canadians know that while the opposition is focusing
              
                some hon. eos"
sos the hon. eos sos minister of finance has the floor. eos,"sos mr. speaker, while the opposition wants to focus on me, we want to focus on canadians. eos sos that is the work we are doing today, by talking about the historic change of the federal government taking a role that has not been taken for 50 years in housing, distributing a huge amount of help to 500,000 families, allowing them to have more money in their pocket for housing, and a key to a house. eos"
sos that is unacceptable. eos sos why is the minister of finance not being straight with canadians? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the reason the hon. eos sos opposition member is focusing on me is because he does not want to focus on canadians. eos"
sos the minister of finance still has private numbered companies. eos sos why is the minister not answering canadians' questions and why has he not disclosed all his assets so that canadians can finally properly judge him? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i will continue to do important work on behalf of canadians while the opposition focuses on me. eos sos it is very important to continue strengthening our economy. eos"
"sos he can continue to keep canadians in the dark, or he can reveal what assets he has owned in numbered companies over the last two years, or what exactly the finance minister is trying to hide. eos sos yes, we are focused on the finance minister. eos","sos mr. speaker, as often as the opposition focuses on personal attacks, we are going to focus on what we are doing for canadians. eos sos that, we know is important. eos"
"sos let us give the finance minister a chance to be accountable, and instead of keeping canadians in the dark. eos sos let him reveal to canadians what assets he has held, be accountable for his actions, own up, stand up, and take some leadership. eos","sos mr. speaker, i am accountable, and i will continue to be accountable to canadians. eos sos while the opposition focuses on fabrications, i will focus on being accountable to results for canadians. eos"
sos some 1.7million canadian families are having a hard time finding places to live. eos sos will the government create a true partnership with the provinces and municipalities in order to tailor the strategy to local realities? eos,"sos mr. speaker, today is a very important day with regard to improving housing outcomes in our country. eos sos we will continue to work with the provinces and municipalities, but today we are announcing how we can improve the situation now. eos"
sos families are desperate for help. eos sos when will the government stop making excuses and fix this problem? eos,"sos mr. speaker, no changes have been made to the eligibility criteria for the disability tax credit or the tax credit for people with diabetes. eos sos for 10 years, the previous conservative government made cuts to scientific research. eos"
"sos the government is raising taxes on diabetics, small businesses, and middle-class families, and it will not even pick up the phone to answer questions. eos sos why does the government only answer questions for wealthy liberal insiders and hang up on everyone else? eos","sos mr. speaker, we have an action plan for improving the quality of services the agency provides to canadians. eos sos we have no lessons to learn from the conservatives, who chose to make cuts to the call centres year after year. eos"
sos that represents almost half of the people who called the minister. eos sos i want to ask the minister of finance a simple question: when will he pick up the phone and answer the calls of concerned entrepreneurs? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i will repeat that i agree with all of the auditor general's recommendations. eos sos the former conservative government decided to cut services, cut staff, and to cut the evaluation of the quality of services. eos"
"sos we are here, at the heart of representative democracy, and at the heart of the trust that the public must have in its representatives. eos sos this vote should be taken again, since it was tainted. eos",sos i thank the hon. eos sos member for montcalm for raising this point of order. eos
"sos mr. speaker, i wish to seek consent for the following motion: that this house call on the department of transport to prohibit the carrying of a knife with a blade measuring less than six centimetres on board aircraft. eos",sos does the hon. eos sos member have the unanimous consent of the house to move the motion? eos
"sos clearly, the government cares a thousand times more about its image than protecting the environment. eos sos will the liberals apologize to vancouver islanders and finally act to create a permanent, dedicated, and annual fund to help with marine debris cleanups? eos","sos mr. speaker, i can assure the member opposite that we care greatly about the environment, that we are concerned about this incident, that parks canada is involved with the cleanup, and that we will continue to work very hard to ensure that we protect our oceans. eos sos as members know, we have our oceans protection plan. eos"
"sos the prime minister wasted no time saying he believed him, that everything was fine and that bronfman was beyond reproach. eos sos is the prime minister still proud of his bagman? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government has taken concrete steps over the past two years to fight tax evasion and avoidance. eos sos we have invested close to $1billion in fighting tax evasion. eos"
"sos the minister is an honourable woman, so she must see how ludicrous this all is. eos sos can she rise and assure canadians that the bronfman case will get the appropriate scrutiny? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government is strongly committed to combatting tax evasion, and the canada revenue agency will treat all cases the same way. eos sos the agency receives 30million returns every year. eos"
"sos however, today we learned that he still had ties to a trust in the cayman islands in 2005. here is a very simple multiple-choice question: a) stephen bronfman lied to the prime minister;  b) the prime minister misled the house. eos sos which answer is correct? eos","sos mr. speaker, i am proud of the role canada has taken on the international stage. eos sos co-operation between revenue authorities, including the exchange of tax information, is an essential tool for maintaining the integrity of canada's tax base. eos"
sos the government seems to be very content to accept whatever fish tale their well-connected friends cook up. eos sos when will the minister understand that canadians are fed up with this double standard? eos,"sos mr. speaker, no one is above the law and no one is interfering with the cra's investigations. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, yesterday, the liberal government finally announced its housing strategy
              
                some hon. eos sos members: oh, oh! eos",sos order. eos sos the hon. eos
"sos the member for spadinafort york called the right to housing a slogan. eos sos for the ndp, the right to housing is never a partisan issue, so why did the government vote against it? eos","sos mr. speaker, we believe that every canadian deserves a home that is safe, affordable, and adequate. eos sos we want every canadian to live somewhere that feels like home, so everyone has an equal chance to succeed in this country. eos"
"sos what a load of hooey. eos sos will the government listen and respect the concept of asymmetry, or will it just impose its own decision yet again? eos","sos mr. speaker, i thank the hon. eos sos member for the question. eos"
sos will the minister of finance disclose all of his assets? eos sos canadians might then be able to trust him. eos,"sos mr. speaker, the member for beauce has been here long enough to know that the institution responsible for preserving the integrity of parliament is the ethics commissioner. eos sos ever since he first arrived here in ottawa, the minister of finance has always worked with the ethics commissioner and presented his situation. eos"
sos that is why we tabled a motion in the house today to ensure that we know the full extent of the minister's assets and that there are no other conflicts of interest. eos sos could the finance minister disclose his assets to canadians? eos,"sos mr. speaker, as i said, the institution responsible for maintaining the integrity of parliament is the ethics commissioner. eos sos the finance minister has always worked with the ethics commissioner to ensure that he complies with the rules governing the house and her recommendations, which he did by putting in place a conflict of interest screen, among other things. eos"
"sos there was no blind trust, no sign off from the ethics commissioner, and now he is under investigation yet again. eos sos will the finance minister finally open up the curtains and let the let shine in, or is he content to continue to keep canadians in the dark night? eos","sos mr. speaker, if it is true that we are defined by what we do and perhaps by what we do not do, what the finance minister has not done is to mismanage the economy the way they mismanaged it for 10 years. eos sos what he has done is create half a million jobs in this country, most of them full time; grow the economy at a faster pace than they ever could; reduce child poverty by 40%; reduce taxes for nine million canadians; go back on the regressive policies they put forward, such as doubling the tfsa limit that would benefit the 3% of wealthiest canadians, so we can give more to canadians who need it the most; and yesterday we announced a national housing strategy they should have done a long time ago. eos"
"sos it seems impossible for him to even acknowledge he is under investigation by the ethics commissioner yet again. eos sos why will the finance minister not do what, up until now, has been impossible for him: be the hero that canada needs now and reveal all of the assets he has been hiding in his other private numbered companies? eos","sos mr. speaker, what was impossible for them for 10 years was to grow this economy. eos sos remember, two years ago we were debating if we were in a recession or heading into a recession. eos"
"sos while telecom companies have the capacity to beef up their security, what we need is leadership and legislation from the federal government. eos sos will the minister finally take canadians' privacy seriously and modernize our laws? eos","sos mr. speaker, this matter falls under the jurisdiction of cse, the communications security establishment. eos sos it, indeed, has worked very closely with industry, including the service providers, to make sure they have the advice and the knowledge they need to correct the problem and to ensure the privacy of canadians is secure. eos"
sos we are lagging far behind in this area. eos sos will the minister commit today to reviewing the legislation and finally modernizing the legislative framework in order to protect canadians' privacy? eos,"sos mr. speaker, indeed, that work is already under way. eos sos a cyber review has been conducted over the last number of months. eos"
sos i appreciate the time the minister of national revenue and her parliamentary secretary took to meet with me to discuss the situation and to allow me to share the concerns i have heard. eos sos could the minister of national revenue inform the house on the steps she is taking to make sure that canadians with disabilities have their concerns heard by the cra? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i thank my colleague from brampton south for her question and for working so hard on behalf of her constituents. eos sos our government pledged that the agency would administer measures for persons with disabilities in a fair, transparent, and accessible way. eos"
sos our security agencies do not know how many of these traitors to the nation are roaming free or where they are. eos sos will the minister be honest with canadians and give us the facts? eos,"sos mr. speaker, indeed, the statistics that i gave were accurate. eos sos canada works constantly with all of our allies, the five eyes, g7, interpol, and others to know as much as possible about every threat. eos"
"sos the numbers he shared were taken from statements made by the director of csis in march 2016. the minister needs to wake up, take this issue seriously, and give canadians accurate information. eos sos we want to know where these traitors to the nation are and whether they are being monitored 24-7. eos","sos mr. speaker, for about the fourth or fifth time now, the fact of the matter is that the statistics i have cited in the house are accurate. eos sos the numbers today remain essentially the same as they were two years ago. eos"
sos how can the minister claim to be surveilling all isis fighters in canada if he is using two-year-old data and saying it is accurate? eos sos is he claiming that no new terrorists have entered canada in the last two years or is he admitting that there are terrorists here that he is no longer watching? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the objective of the government of canada with respect to extremist travellers is to surveil them and contain them to ensure that they do not harm more people, and indeed
              
                some hon. eos sos members: oh, oh! eos"
sos the hon. eos sos minister of public safety has the floor. eos,"sos mr. speaker, the objective of the government of canada is to surveil them and contain them to ensure that they do not harm more people, and indeed bring the full force of canadian justice against them for fighting for a terrorist organization. eos sos i know the member for calgary nose hill must agree with those words, because that is what she herself said word for word in this house last night. eos"
"sos he is standing up and saying that all of these people are under surveillance, but he will not give the number of people who are in canada who have come in over the last two years. eos sos therefore, very simply, how many people in this situation have come in over the last two years, and how many are under 24-hour surveillance? eos","sos mr. speaker, the fact of the matter is the number released by csis two years ago was in the order of 60, and it has confirmed that number remains essentially the same today. eos sos whenever the security and police forces of our country recognize a threat, they take all appropriate measures to deal with that threat. eos"
sos that is unacceptable. eos sos why are seasonal workers still waiting for help? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government is committed to ensuring that canadians get support when they need it. eos sos the series of changes that we have put into place to improve the ei program are benefiting canadians across the country. eos"
sos he broke the trust of 35million canadians. eos sos will the minister of finance finally let the sun cast some light on his personal finances or will he continue to hide in the shadow of his many numbered companies? eos,"sos mr. speaker, as my colleague from mganticl'rable knows, every parliamentarian in the house, including ministers and parliamentary secretaries, are required to sit down with the ethics commissioner when they arrive in ottawa and present their entire situation in order to determine the best course of action to take. eos sos the minister of finance did that. eos"
"sos after five months and five rounds of negotiations, when will the minister admit that their plan is not working? eos sos when will the minister start fighting for jobs, not just for her ideology? eos","sos mr. speaker, one of canada's strengths in this difficult negotiation has been our ability to rise above petty partisan politics and to all play for team canada. eos sos having said that, stephen harper has recently proposed a different approach, and so i would like to take this opportunity to ask my hon. eos"
"sos the prime minister likes to suggest his strength is his progressive agenda, but in washington the minister told our stakeholders that those will be non-enforceable, non-binding measures. eos sos why is canada putting non-binding priorities forward when it should be fighting for softwood, for auto, for agriculture, and for the jobs that we need? eos","sos mr. speaker, our negotiating position is clear in canada and at the negotiating tables in the united states and mexico. eos sos we will defend and maintain those elements of nafta that canadians know are essential to our national interest. eos"
"sos we have always taken a constructive approach and tried to work with the current government and we have advocated for canada's position. eos sos rather than pre-emptively deliver talking points explaining the liberals' failure on nafta, we want to know when the minister will get serious and actually start fighting to protect the jobs of canadian workers. eos","sos mr. speaker, i want canadians and all members of this house to know that i take these negotiations absolutely seriously, as all canadians expect of us. eos sos we made some reasonable progress on some of the more technical chapters at the latest round, but significant differences remain. eos"
"sos the national housing strategy is a historic document for many reasons, including its recognition that every canadian has the right to adequate housing. eos sos could the minister responsible for housing explain this rights-based approach? eos","sos mr. speaker, housing rights are human rights, and i want to thank the member for cambridge for drawing attention to this government's historic commitment to housing rights. eos sos our commitment is grounded in the principles of accountability, participation, and of course non-discrimination. eos"
sos there are recurring problems there. eos sos did the minister responsible for official languages forget that it is her responsibility to ensure bilingual services in every government agency? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the hon. eos sos gentleman has a very important point. eos"
sos families who save for their children's education give them a better chance of graduating without incurring significant debt. eos sos can the minister tell us about the measures being taken in the house to ensure that our families are able to save for their children's education? eos,"sos mr. speaker, this year, the one millionth child received the canada learning bond, meaning one million canadian families have had a head start for their child's education. eos sos making post-secondary education more affordable for canadians is critical to helping them find a good job in their future. eos"
sos surely the minister has done this assessment. eos sos will the minister now release this analysis so canadians can learn how many jobs are at risk as a result of these changes? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we welcome the report of the parliamentary budget officer, who is confirming what we have been saying all along, that 3% of canadian-controlled private corporations hold more than 80% of all the passive income in canada and that 97% of canadian-controlled private corporations will not be affected by these changes. eos sos our objective has always been to improve tax fairness. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, on behalf of the  leader of the opposition in the house of commons, i would like to ask the leader of the government in the house of commons what business will be in the house for the remainder of this week and next week. eos","sos mr. speaker, this afternoon, we will continue the debate begun this morning on the conservative party's opposition motion. eos sos tomorrow, we will have the second and last day of debate at third reading stage of billc-45 on cannabis. eos"
sos our record low wild salmon returns will only get worse until the government starts taking meaningful action to save wild salmon. eos sos when will the minister enforce the law and stop kinder morgan from damaging critical salmon habitat? eos,"sos mr. speaker, my colleague knows that this government is working very hard to protect wild salmon stocks in this province. eos sos in fact, we are investing record amounts of money in marine and ocean science. eos"
"sos the media is saying that the prime minister plans to go to china by the end of the year, despite serious human rights concerns, lax labour laws, threats to canadian intellectual property, and the list goes on. eos sos why is the liberal party moving full speed ahead to enter into a free trade agreement with china? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government's progressive and strategically developed trade agenda draws on rules from throughout the asia-pacific region. eos sos guided at all times by our values, it will eventually lead to new trade opportunities. eos"
sos the liberals will not even stand up to unfair steel dumping by china that is costing jobs in our steel industry right now. eos sos how can canadians possibly trust the government to defend canadian values and jobs in any new trade negotiations with china? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the world has seen that canada will always stand up for canadians when it comes to trade negotiations. eos sos they saw that in asia last week. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, after the paradise papers revealed the top liberal fundraiser's connection to a cayman islands tax evasion scheme, he said stephen bronfman had no other direct or indirect involvement whatsoever in the kolber trust, that trust being located in the cayman islands. eos sos we now know that connection came in the form of a $7 million loan that was still in place as of 2005. does the prime minister still believe mr. bronfman has no connection to this trust? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government understands that this is a multi-billion-dollar issue, and we have invested nearly $1billion over the past two years to tackle it. eos sos the cra uses the information it receives through lists shared by its international partners as part of the beps project. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, when the original revelations about stephen bronfman's connections to a cayman islands tax haven came to light earlier this month, the prime minister said, we have received assurances that all rules were followed...and we are satisfied with those assurances. eos sos is the prime minister still satisfied with the assurances that his top fundraiser followed all the rules? eos","sos mr. speaker, i repeat, these accusations are utterly ridiculous. eos sos no one is above the law, no one is interfering with the cra's audits, and the law applies to everyone. eos"
"sos her job is to ensure that her department conducts these investigations totally objectively, but she has now predetermined the outcome by declaring that the allegations are ridiculous. eos sos how can canadians have any assurance that there will be an honest investigation into mr. bronfman when both the prime minister and the minister have declared him not guilty? eos","sos mr. speaker, former national revenue minister jean-pierre blackburn publicly admitted that this was not a priority for the former conservative government. eos sos it is a priority for us, however. eos"
"sos we have new revelations from the paradise papers, suggesting a link between mr. bronfman and this potentially illegal tax haven. eos sos how can the minister possibly think it appropriate for her to stand and exonerate him before her department has even had a chance to conduct its investigation? eos","sos mr. speaker, no one is above the law, and my colleague opposite knows perfectly well that i cannot comment on any case involving the 30million people and companies that file tax returns. eos sos some hon. eos"
sos the hon. eos sos minister of national revenue. eos,"sos mr. speaker, we understand that this is a touchy subject for our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, given that fighting tax evasion was not a priority for their government, whereas we have made it a priority by investing $1billion. eos sos we are targeting four jurisdictions a year and carrying out criminal investigations. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, i am looking for assurance here. eos sos will the minister assure canadians that neither she nor the prime minister will stand in the way of an investigation by her department into mr. bronfman. eos","sos mr. speaker, i am happy to assure my colleague across the way by reiterating that no one is above the law and no one, and i mean no one, will interfere with the audits and investigations carried out by the cra. eos sos i trust that my colleague is reassured. eos"
sos what is this government waiting for to immediately commission the construction of a second replenishment ship? eos sos this is a national security issue. eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government has reiterated its commitment to the national shipbuilding strategy. eos sos the strategy includes a $2-billion small-ship construction program for competitive procurement among davie and other canadian shipyards other than the yards selected to build large vessels. eos"
"sos in fact, it says that high-income individuals aimed to recognize income in the 2015 tax year, before the new 33% tax rate came into effect. eos sos what kind of tax strategies did these wealthy canadians use to declare that income a year earlier? eos","sos madam speaker, the tax strategy that we have put forward to reduce inequalities in this country and to make sure that the middle class has more money is to increase taxes on the wealthiest 1% and to lower them for nine million canadians, a measure the conservatives voted against. eos sos we came forward with the canada child benefit that is lifting 300,000 kids out of poverty in this country, reducing child poverty by 40%, a measure they voted against. eos"
"sos as a result, in the week following that december 7 announcement, the stock market dropped by 5%. eos sos did the finance minister anticipate this reaction? eos","sos madam speaker, as i said, we are working to make sure canadian businesses have everything they need to succeed. eos sos we realize that canadian business owners are crucial to our economic growth. eos"
"sos madam speaker, the focus of many in the stock market was to sell their shares after the december 7 announcement this minister made in order to realize any capital gains in the 2015 year, before the tax rate went up. eos sos as a result, the stock market in canada dropped 5% subsequent to the minister's announcement on december 7. i ask again, did the finance minister anticipate that the markets would react in this way to his december 7 announcement? eos","sos madam speaker, what canadians anticipated under the previous conservative government was sluggish growth. eos sos the conservatives had the worst growth and highest unemployment since world war ii. eos"
sos he only takes action when cornered. eos sos will the minister of finance finally tell canadians the truth about his private numbered companies? eos,"sos madam speaker, my colleague from louis-saint-laurent is an experienced parliamentarian who knows that, in parliament, we have institutions responsible for maintaining the integrity of parliament. eos sos the expectation is that ministers and all parliamentarians will work with the ethics commissioner by disclosing their assets to her so she can provide guidance as to how they can fully comply with the rules that govern us in the house. eos"
sos i ask the member for louis-hbert again: when will the minister of finance finally tell canadians the truth and disclose all of his assets? eos sos that is what canadians want to know. eos,"sos madam speaker, the minister of finance has always told the ethics commissioner the truth. eos sos when the minister arrived in ottawa, the ethics commissioner recommended that he put in place a conflict of interest screen, a measure that was good enough for the opposition ministers and the conservative government ministers, when the conservatives were in office. eos"
sos it is clear that canadians have lost trust and faith in the finance minister's ability to do his job. eos sos is justifying illegal activity and poor judgment the new standard of the ottawa liberals? eos,"sos madam speaker, i will tell members who had lost faith in the ability of anyone to do their job. eos sos canadians had lost faith in the ability of the conservatives to do their job when it came to managing the economy. eos"
"sos why, we're the finance minister's private holdings, of course. eos sos will the finance minister help us solve this ethics riddle and tell us what is in those private holdings? eos","sos madam speaker, as the member knows, we have institutions in this place that are there to safeguard the integrity of parliament. eos sos we trust the ethics commissioner's ability and impartiality to do her job. eos"
sos why is the minister of finance doing things that undermine canadians' trust? eos sos when will he knock down that wall and be open and transparent about his numbered companies? eos,"sos mr. speaker, for years, we watched the conservatives chip away at the institutions of parliament, so i am not surprised in the least to hear the opposition member attack a measure that the ethics commissioner herself deemed the best possible way to comply with the guidelines. eos sos none of us should be surprised. eos"
sos the minister of finance has lost the trust of canadians. eos sos when will he come down to earth and come clean on all of his financial affairs? eos,"sos madam speaker, as i said many times, every member and every minister is expected to work with the ethics commissioner, the institution responsible for ensuring respect for the integrity of this place. eos sos the minister of finance did that. eos"
"sos he is now one of three liberals, including the prime minister, under investigation by the ethics commissioner. eos sos do the liberals actually know the difference between right and wrong? eos","sos madam speaker, on the difference between right and wrong, i would ask that question of the 10 years of the harper conservatives when they doubled the tfsa limit that benefited the 3% wealthiest; when they scrapped our environmental protection laws in the country; when they disrespected institutions of this parliament; and when they disrespected the supreme court? eos sos that is a question canadians ask every day about the previous harper conservatives. eos"
"sos his chief of staff, his most senior, closest and political assistant who is hired by the minister, reports to the minister, and can be fired by the minister. eos sos do the liberals not even see the conflicts within their own conflicts? eos","sos madam speaker, as i said, i am not surprised that the conservatives are questioning the judgment of the ethics commissioner, who is doing her work in a non-partisan and independent manner. eos sos she recommended that a conflict of interest screen be put in place as she believed that it was the best possible measure of compliance. eos"
"sos in response to the deadlock, canada has quietly begun telling our stakeholders that all the canadian proposals will be non-binding. eos sos will the minister admit to the house that they have been telling nafta stakeholders that canada's progressive priorities will not be binding on the united states or mexico? eos","sos madam speaker, our negotiating position is clear, and we will defend and maintain the elements of nafta that canadians know are central to our national interest. eos sos we are negotiating in good faith with our partners, but we cannot and will not accept proposals that put canadian jobs at risk and do harm to our economy. eos"
sos the liberals' billc-64 fails to properly address the problem of vessels being left to rot for years in shoreline communities. eos sos will the liberals finally work with these communities and with the ndp by debating billc-352 in order to fill the gaps in their own bill? eos,"sos madam speaker, we know that protecting our oceans is absolutely essential. eos sos that is why we introduced the oceans protection plan. eos"
sos why is the government blocking my legislation? eos sos why is it stifling coastal voices? eos,"sos madam speaker, as i have already mentioned, canadians expect a government to come out with legislation that is comprehensive, long term, integrated, multi-jurisdictional, and negotiated. eos sos that is exactly what we are doing. eos"

"sos by enshrining the right to housing for all canadians into this strategy, the government is playing a key role in reducing homelessness and poverty. eos sos [english] can the parliamentary secretary to the minister of families, children and social development  share with this house how seniors like those in my riding of mississaugalakeshore, who are advocating for more affordable housing, will benefit from this new strategy? eos","sos madam speaker, i can attest to witnessing first-hand the actions of the member from mississaugalakeshore and his commitment to seniors and seniors housing. eos sos i attended a massive town hall with him as part of the consultations that led to the rollout of the national housing strategy. eos"

"sos in light of these new revelations, is the prime minister still happy with his situation? eos sos is he still protecting his billionaire liberal friend? eos","sos madam speaker, as my colleague knows, i will not comment on individual cases today, tomorrow, next year, or ever. eos sos the law prohibits me from doing so. eos"
"sos madam speaker, the liberal party's chief fundraiser, stephen bronfman, denied links to offshore tax havens after 1998. however, documents show that bronfman family companies were still owed millions from their trust in the cayman islands in 2005. the prime minister does not seem concerned that his friend has apparently misled him, and he certainly seems blind to the fact that his millionaire liberal cronies have been cheating canada. eos sos is the prime minister still satisfied with his friend's version of the facts, despite very clear evidence to the contrary? eos","sos madam speaker, as my colleague knows, i will not comment on individual cases today, tomorrow, next week, next year, or ever. eos sos the law prohibits me from doing so. eos"

"sos when over half of all calls to the cra are blocked and 30% of callers are getting the wrong information, it seems clear to me that in-person service needs to be restored in rural areas. eos sos when will she face the facts and admit that nothing is more effective than in-person service? eos","sos madam speaker, we agree with all of the auditor general's recommendations. eos sos the previous conservative government decided to reduce services to canadians by cutting funding for call centres. eos"

"sos they also claim to support and respect the members of the canadian armed forces, but the liberals are cutting the pay of our brave soldiers who have served in some of the most dangerous missions in the world while at the same time pandering to canadian isis terrorists by giving them taxpayer-funded reintegration programs. eos sos why are the liberals choosing canadian terrorists over the brave women and men who have fought against them? eos","sos madam speaker, canada was present in the fight against daesh. eos sos working with the iraqis, and primarily the kurds, we helped recapture mosul and restore peace and international stability in this region. eos"
"sos the liberals are proposing a state-funded program for radicalized terrorists, but they are not even providing a similar level of service to law-abiding canadian citizens. eos sos why should terrorists who fought against our country be entitled to free reintegration services even as the liberals abandon our own veterans and serving military members? eos","sos madam speaker, i should set the record straight for my colleague opposite. eos sos it is not true that our soldiers have been subjected to pay cuts or lost income. eos"
sos now liberal party members are disavowing the minister of finance. eos sos does the minister of finance realize that canadians have completely lost confidence in him? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i worked with the ethics commissioner to ensure that i was not in a conflict of interest. eos sos in addition, i decided that there should be no perception of a potential conflict of interest, so i decided to sell all of my shares in my former company. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, the finance minister is trying to sweep this whole thing under the rug by repeating that everything is fine now, as though he can snap his fingers and magically become a person of real integrity and transparency after being in a conflict of interest for two years. eos sos since the minister of finance did not place his shares in a blind trust, does that not mean that he was in fact in a direct conflict of interest for the past two years? eos","sos mr. speaker, i understand why opposition members want to talk about me. eos sos it is because they do not want to talk about canadians. eos"
sos that is the only way to know whether the minister's personal interests conflict with his public duties as finance minister. eos sos the question is simple: will the liberal members across the aisle show transparency and integrity by voting in favour of our motion this evening? eos,"sos mr. speaker, as i said, i worked with the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner to make sure i was not in any conflict of interest. eos sos the important thing is for me to continue to work for canadians. eos"
"sos however, the fact that he is refusing to answer this question directly and that the liberals refuse to support our motion, demonstrates his unwillingness to be transparent with canadians. eos sos why will the finance minister not simply answer the question and reveal to canadians what assets he has owned over the last two years? eos","sos mr. speaker, from day one, i have disclosed 100% of my assets to the ethics commissioner. eos sos that is the way it works in the house. eos"

"sos now we know that his former company, morneau shepell, regularly signs multi-million-dollar contracts with the government. eos sos knowing this, can the minister explain why, shortly after the election, the president and ceo of morneau shepell told his shareholders, and i quote, government and other public sector organizations represent a significant growth opportunity? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government is committed to open, fair, and transparent procurement processes. eos sos through proactive disclosure of contracts, our government operates according to the principles of openness, transparency, and accountability. eos"
"sos they talk with their constituents the way we do, and they know that canadians are fed up with liberals working for themselves and for their friends. eos sos how does the finance minister hope to regain the trust of canadians when even his own colleagues are starting to lose faith in him? eos","sos mr. speaker, the way we will work for canadians is the way that we have worked for the last two years. eos sos we will think every day about how we can improve our economy and we will think every day about how we can ensure that middle-class canadians see success as a result of that work. eos"
sos what else is she hiding? eos sos her incompetence? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i read the auditor general's report and i agree with all his recommendations. eos sos in our first budget, we invested $50million to help our call centres provide better service to canadians. eos"
"sos i have a simple question. eos sos will the liberals prove to canadians they are working for the middle class by closing tax loopholes to make sure their wealthy friends stop abusive tax avoidance, yes or no? eos","sos mr. speaker, we are fully committed to fighting tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. eos sos the ndp is talking about the importance of fighting tax evasion and is criticizing what we are doing about it. eos"
"sos a week before the minister introduced his measures on the floor of the house of commons, someone sold $10 million of morneau shepell shares. eos sos was it him? eos","sos mr. speaker, i will continue to advocate on behalf of a tax system that is broken. eos sos what we did was something that we believe was absolutely the right thing to do. eos"
sos just clear it up. eos,sos yes or no? eos
sos the hon. eos sos minister of finance has the floor. eos,"sos as i said, mr. speaker, we were very pleased to move forward on a package of tax changes that made an enormous difference on nine million canadians. eos sos lowering taxes on middle-class canadians was financed by raising taxes on the top 1%. eos"
sos that person saved a cool half million dollars. eos sos was the minister that person? eos,"sos mr. speaker, members across the way will continue to focus on me because they do not want to talk about what is actually going on. eos sos what is actually going on is that the policies we put in place are making a better situation for our economy and a better situation for canadian families. eos"
"sos why does that hon. eos sos member, if he made no mistake or he broke no rules in the timing of the sale of shares, not stand now and tell us when he sold his 680,000 shares in morneau shepell? eos","sos mr. speaker, i am well aware of the fact that the opposition will continue to focus on me so they do not focus on what is actually going on here. eos sos we will continue to talk about what we are doing for canadians in every dimension, in our housing policy, in helping with child benefits, and making sure that we get fair trade agreements. eos"
sos it has been over 10 years and this dark chapter in our history has yet to close. eos sos will the liberal government finally call for a public inquiry and accept that justice is something they should call for not only when they are in the opposition. eos,"sos mr. speaker, canada is a strong supporter of the international criminal court and its work to ensure accountability for war crimes. eos sos torture is abhorrent and illegal. eos"
"sos for years, we have been asking the government to launch a truly public, open, and transparent inquiry to get to the truth of the matter. eos sos now that a legal expert has asked the international criminal court to include canada in its investigation into possible war crimes in afghanistan, will the government promise to collaborate? eos","sos mr. speaker, canada is proud to support the international criminal court. eos sos torture is abhorrent and illegal. eos"
"sos addressing and making amends to the survivors of this dark chapter, a part of our history, is a vital part of our country's commitment to meaningful reconciliation. eos sos can the minister of crown-indigenous relations update the house on canada's efforts to support the survivors' journey of healing with the former students of residential schools in newfoundland and labrador? eos","sos mr. speaker, the abuse suffered by indigenous children at newfoundland and labrador residential schools was a horrific part of our history. eos sos their exclusion from the 2008 residential schools apology was simply wrong. eos"
"sos the markets learned on december 7 the coming into force date of tax increases that moved markets, but not before someone was able to get out and avoid the losses. eos sos was the minister of finance that person? eos","sos mr. speaker, this is a very nice opportunity for us to talk about promises that were kept. eos sos promises that were kept include reducing taxes on middle-class canadians and, for nine million canadians, seeing a 7% reduction in the tax bracket from $45,000 to $90,000. eos"
"sos that news moved markets, but not before someone was able to sell their shares and save half a million dollars. eos sos was that person the minister of finance? eos","sos mr. speaker, i am not sure how we can be more clear. eos sos we promised canadians that we would lower middle-class taxes. eos"
"sos trading records show that somebody sold over 10-million dollars' worth of morneau shepell shares one week before the minister introduced tax measures that caused morneau shepell to drop by 5%. eos sos was that seller the minister of finance, yes or no? eos","sos mr. speaker, in focusing on me, what the opposition does not want to focus on is what we are actually doing for canadians. eos sos there are 36 million canadians, nine million of them were advantaged with our middle-class tax cut. eos"
"sos if he has nothing to hide, he would just continue that practice now. eos sos did the minister sell his shares in morneau shepell in the amount of $10 million exactly one week before he tabled in the house of commons market-moving tax changes? eos","sos mr. speaker, as the member opposite well knows, we all work together with the ethics commissioner to make sure that all of our financial affairs are fully disclosed. eos sos that is what i have done from day one. eos"
"sos however, somebody knew enough to sell $10 million of morneau shepell shares before that drop could occur, saving him half a million dollars. eos sos once again, was that the minister? eos","sos mr. speaker, the member opposite might take a look at the stock market and see that it has gone up over the last couple of years. eos sos it may be unknown to him, but that is a result of some things that have gone on in the global economy, something that has gone on, as well, within the canadian economy, and that is that our economy is doing well. eos"
"sos it is impossible. eos sos when will the prime minister finally keep his promise, stop doing consultations, and overhaul ei sickness benefits? eos","sos mr. speaker, i am delighted to be part of a government that believes the employment insurance system has a role to play in providing an income to families going through hard times and to communities that are suffering. eos sos since 2016, we have implemented solid measures to make the ei system more flexible and more generous. eos"
"sos can the minister tell canadians the truth? eos sos did he or did he not sell those morneau shepell shares on november 30, 2015? eos","sos mr. speaker, like all members of the house, i worked with the ethics commissioner to ensure that i am free from conflicts of interest. eos sos i will continue to work for canadians to improve our economic situation and to make things better for the middle class and for families across canada. eos"
"sos will he finally tell canadians the truth? eos sos did he or someone else sell shares on november 30, just before he introduced a tax provision that led to a 5% drop and a $500,000 profit for the person who sold these shares? eos","sos mr. speaker, i know that opposition members want to focus on me because they do not want to focus on canadians. eos sos we are far better off than we were before. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, prominent financial advisers told investors, in publications across the country, to sell their shares and realize their gains before the end of the calendar year of 2015, after the minister introduced his tax measures on the floor of the house of commons, but a week before he did that, somebody sold $10 million of shares in morneau shepell, saving half a million dollars by avoiding the consequent drop in the stock market. eos sos if the minister has nothing to hide, could he confirm if that person was him? eos","sos mr. speaker, i have absolutely nothing to hide, and that is why i disclosed all of my assets to the ethics commissioner. eos sos i will continue to work with her the way all members in this house are expected to work with her. eos"

"sos morneau shepell was down 5%, but once again, someone was able to sell their shares a week before that. eos sos was the minister that somebody? eos","sos mr. speaker, as i have said, i will continue to work with the ethics commissioner, because that is the appropriate way members in this house disclose all of their assets, as i did, to make sure that we can do the work that is appropriate. eos sos we will continue with the policies the opposition does not like, the policies that are helping the middle class, the policies that they are not voting against, like the increase in taxes on the 1%. eos"
sos a true nation-to-nation relationship means backing up one's words with real actions. eos sos will the liberals support the first ever indigenous-led coastal protection strategy? eos,"sos mr. speaker, as you know, we are determined to improve marine safety. eos sos that is why we have put in place the oceans protection plan. eos"
sos will he answer the question? eos sos was he the one who sold those shares at that time? eos,"sos mr. speaker, what is clear is that the member opposite might not understand how it works in this house. eos sos the way it works is that we work with the ethics commissioner to disclose all of our assets, which is exactly what i have done in order to make sure that i can get on with the work that is going to make a difference for canadians. eos"
"sos all they want is to work, but no, ottawa prefers to enrich the irvings. eos sos will the prime minister go and see the 800 workers and tell them why he decided to send their jobs to halifax? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government is always concerned about the impact of job losses on workers and their families. eos sos we recognize the excellent work of davie employees. eos"
"sos how does he expect to be able to defend three oceans with only a single supply ship for two fleets, and why is he jeopardizing 800jobs in quebec when quebec produced the jewel of the canadian fleet at low prices and on time? eos sos i would like him to explain that to me. eos","sos mr. speaker, the navy is in the midst of one of the most comprehensive fleet modernizations in its peacetime history. eos sos as part of the national capabilities strategy under our new defence policy, our government is acquiring fleet support ships to permanently replace the protecteur class auxiliary oiler replenishment vessels. eos"

"sos this was just before his mission to china. eos sos now that he is back, can the minister update us on our government's plan to create opportunities for canadian farmers, growers, and producers? eos","sos mr. speaker, i thank my hon. eos sos colleague for scarborough north for his question and hard work. eos"
"sos isis specifically trained canadian fighters to come back here and terrorize our community, and the liberals have known about it for over two years. eos sos why is the prime minister so focused on reintegration services and not putting these people in jail? eos","sos mr. speaker, this government, like all governments, takes extremely seriously the safety of canadians, and that is why everything we do is focused on keeping canadians safe. eos sos we know that a society that is safe is one in which we are using a broad range of tools to keep canadians safe. eos"
"sos the prime minister is using a broad spectrum that includes poetry and podcasts, and all kinds of counselling and group hug sessions. eos sos when will the prime minister take the security of canadians seriously and look for ways to put these isis fighters in jail? eos","sos mr. speaker, the conservative party learned nothing from the last election and the lessons canadians taught them. eos sos they ran an election on snitch lines against muslims, they ran an election on islamophobia and division, and still they play the same games, trying to scare canadians. eos"

"sos they sold their shares before the year finished, and therefore were taxed at a lower rate than they wanted charged on other people. eos sos one of them might have been the finance minister, if he did in fact sell the $10 million worth of shares on november 30, 2015. did he? eos","sos mr. speaker, again, we can see the dilemma in which the opposition finds itself. eos sos we have demonstrated that on what was supposed to be their strength, the economy, our plan actually works far better than any of theirs ever did. eos"
"sos it is extraordinary that after three days of questioning, he still cannot tell us if he sold shares in that company just a week before he introduced tax legislation. eos sos with these extraordinary failures, will he resign? eos","sos mr. speaker, on this side of the house we have a very simple principle of listening to canadians. eos sos that is what we did for years while we were the third party in the house. eos"
sos member for carleton. eos sos order. eos,"sos mr. speaker, the prime minister says they have one principle, actually they have two different principles, one for themselves and one for everyone else. eos sos for example, when the minister brought in his tax increase on small businesses, there was a higher rate for the pizza shop owner and the plumber, but no new taxes for his company morneau shepell. eos"
"sos then, at the end of it all, they find themselves unable to actually criticize us because we are doing the right thing, as we said we would, and they have

"sos however, the bill to make the age of consent the same for everyone has been languishing on the order paper for a long time now. eos sos will the prime minister commit to working with us to pass both of these bills before the house rises for the holidays? eos","sos mr. speaker, yesterday was an important day for everyone in the the house, for all canadians, and for future generations. eos sos recognizing the harm we did as an institution and as a country to members of the lgbtq2 community was essential. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, after yesterday's historic apology to the lgbtq community and with the answer we just had from the prime minister, we see an opportunity here to begin to address some of the unfinished business the prime minister has been talking about. eos sos in order to do that, will the prime minister join us in seeking agreement from all members of this house to deal with bill c-66 before christmas, so that gay men with criminal records for same-sex consensual activity can have those records extinguished? eos","sos mr. speaker, i want to thank the member opposite for his long advocacy for human rights, for lgbtq2 rights, and for the rights of all canadians over many years. eos sos it was an honour to stand with him in this house yesterday. eos"
sos the province admits it lacks the necessary powers. eos sos will the environment minister immediately recommend to the government to issue a section 61 order to save these herds? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we take seriously the responsibility of protecting our natural environment. eos sos we know that protecting the environment and growing the economy go together. eos"
sos no less an authority than the un special rapporteur on housing is calling the strategy an incredible moment for canada and our leadership on human rights. eos sos could the prime minister please inform the house what the first-ever national housing strategy means for all canadians? eos,"sos i thank the member for scarborough centre for her extraordinary community leadership. eos sos the national housing strategy is not just the first-ever national housing strategy in canada, it is also the first time a federal government has committed itself to a human rights-based approach to housing. eos"
"sos i have written authorization, so the government cannot hide behind privacy excuses. eos sos will the government right this injustice and give sophie permanent resident status? eos","sos mr. speaker, canada is a generous and compassionate country. eos sos we know that we must help those in need here at home and around the world. eos"
"sos in july, the minister of agriculture signed an agreement with his provincial and territorial counterparts on the canadian agricultural partnership, canada's next five-year agricultural policy framework. eos sos can the prime minister tell the house about the kinds of investments and programs we can expect to see under the canadian agricultural partnership? eos","sos mr. speaker, i thank the member for avignonla mitismatanematapdia for his question and for his leadership of the quebec caucus. eos sos last week, we announced a $1-million federal investment as part of the canadian agricultural partnership. eos"
"sos however, canada's prime minister has decided to delete this information. eos sos will the prime minister stand with the united nations and fgm survivors and reverse his decision? eos","sos mr. speaker, not only do i stand with the united nations on this and many other issues, i actually, personally, brought up this issue when i was in liberia, challenging local leaders and local governments to step up on the fight against fgm. eos sos we will continue to stand against violence against women. eos"
"sos since the liberal government claims to care about information, it must take action and support print media, just like it supported other industries in which so many jobs were at stake. eos sos will the government commit to providing temporary financial assistance to print media and help maintain good jobs, while the industry awaits a permanent solution? eos","sos mr. speaker, we understand how much canadians rely on local media to read the local news that brings them together as a community. eos sos we will continue to spend millions of advertising dollars to support local newspapers. eos"
sos i will now give him the opportunity to answer clearly in french. eos sos did he sell his shares or not? eos,"sos mr. speaker, what we are seeing is the dilemma that the opposition members are grappling with. eos sos they cannot criticize us or even attack us on our economic record, which is extremely positive for canadians, for the middle class. eos"
"sos canadians certainly do expect the minister of finance to be able to tell us whether he was or was not the person who sold 680,000shares one week before he introduced tax measures that led to a 5% drop in the share price of his family business. eos sos was it him or not? eos","sos mr. speaker, it is clear to the members of this house and all canadians that the minister has already answered this question, but the opposition members continue to sling mud because they have nothing else to do. eos sos they cannot criticize us, because in two years we have already achieved a much better economic record and helped far more canadians than they managed to do in 10years, despite their vaunted economic expertise. eos"
"sos canada's finances must be managed by someone who is responsible, transparent, and honest because this is canadians' money we are talking about. eos sos in light of the commissioner's investigations, the minister's personal gains and his refusal to respond to questions about his financial transactions, will the prime minister fire his finance minister, yes or no? eos","sos mr. speaker, what we have learned from talking to canadians, whether it be in lac-saint-jean, south surreywhite rock, or anywhere else in the country, is that they recognize that our economic growth record, the impact of the canada child benefit, the tax cut for the middle class, and the tax hike for the wealthy are helping our communities, helping families, and helping individuals. eos sos that is what we are doing, and that is why the opposition members are conducting a smear campaign, because they cannot find anything else to criticize. eos"
"sos the survivors of st. anne's deserve better. eos sos will he instruct his government to end this obstruction of justice against the survivors of st. anne's, once and for all? eos","sos mr. speaker, the ills done to indigenous people over decades and centuries of colonialism in this country are shameful and are something that we need to learn from and move forward on. eos sos that includes respecting the rights of indigenous people now in all their different aspects. eos"

"sos we need to bring john and allison home. eos sos as the prime minister heads to china next week, will he promise to raise this issue and refuse to discuss any new trade agreement with china until john and allison are released? eos","sos mr. speaker, canadians well know that wherever i travel around the world, i stand up for canadian values and human rights and will continue to, including in china. eos sos the plight of canadians, anywhere around the world, is of deep concern to our government. eos"
sos they do. eos sos will the prime minister now remove all sex discrimination from the indian act? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government is committed to working with first nations, parliamentarians, impacted individuals, and experts to ensure that all sex-based discrimination is eliminated from registration under the indian act. eos sos bill s-3, as passed by the house of commons, remedied all known sex-based discrimination in the indian act registration since the modern indian registry was created. eos"
sos the hon. eos sos member for abitibibaie-jamesnunavikeeyou. eos,"sos mr. speaker, the liberals agreed to the proposed changes to eliminate sex-based discrimination from the indian act, but they will do so only after holding consultations. eos sos indigenous women have been clear from day one that sex-based discrimination should have been eliminated long ago. eos"

"sos it was said then though, as i say now, that still more can and must be done. eos sos can the minister of public safety provide this house, and indeed all canadians, with what additional steps are being taken? eos","sos mr. speaker, earlier this week i was very proud to introduce bill c-66, which would allow the expungement of convictions involving consensual sexual activity between same-sex and age-appropriate partners. eos sos people will be able to apply for themselves or for a loved one who has passed away. eos"
"sos earlier the minister said that he did not know when his shares had been sold. eos sos on behalf of the people of canada, why is it so hard for the minister of finance to come clean with canadians? eos","sos mr. speaker, as i said, there are no secrets here. eos sos my decisions have been published in the press. eos"
"sos that does not scare me, because my job is to ask questions, and i will continue to do just that. eos sos was it you who sold the 680,000shares, yes or no? eos","sos as i already mentioned to one member today, members need to address their comments to the chair. eos sos when members say you here, they are talking to me, and i do not think that the member was talking to me in this case. eos"
"sos if he has something important to say, then it is important that he say it here. eos sos it is also important to say it in the foyer because that way we can understand what he means and see whether he is telling the truth. eos","sos mr. speaker, days before introducing tax rate changes that affected the value of many different stocks, did the finance minister sell 680,000 shares of morneau shepell on november 30, 2015? eos"
"sos some hon. eos sos members: oh, oh! eos",sos order. eos sos i have to ask the member for brantfordbrant to try not to interrupt when someone else has the floor. eos
"sos mr. speaker, days before introducing tax rate changes that affected the value of many different stocks, did the finance minister sell 680,000 morneau shepell shares on november 30, 2015? eos","sos mr. speaker, i am not sure how many times we will have the same question asked. eos sos as i said, i gave direction to sell the shares in my company when i was elected. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, the minister says he gave direction to sell the shares in morneau shepell, but he would not have been giving that direction to a trustee of a blind trust, because we now know, contrary to his earlier suggestions, that he had no blind trust. eos sos therefore, to whom did he give those directions, and can he provide us with the precise details of those directions? eos","sos mr. speaker, for weeks we have been asked a question in this house about whether or not i worked with the ethics commissioner. eos sos the answer is that i worked with the ethics commissioner to show her all of my assets. eos"
sos how many lost jobs will it take for the minister to lift a finger? eos sos how many members from her own caucus will it take for her to consider this issue? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we have always been clear on the subject: we value the importance of journalism and every year we help the print media by providing up to $75 million through the canada periodical fund. eos sos as part of our new vision for a creative canada, we said that we will continue to support local media and we are also going to help local media that are not yet online, meaning those still available in print form, to transition to the digital world since that is how more and more people are accessing the news. eos"
"sos in order to achieve gender equality, women and girls, including indigenous women, must be able to fully participate in their communities and in democratic and public life. eos sos [english] can the parliamentary secretary for status of women inform the house how this government is supporting indigenous women's empowerment and achieving gender equality? eos","sos mr. speaker, i thank my colleague from vimy for that question. eos sos [english]
              eliminating gender-based violence is critical to allowing women and girls to reach their full potential, and to achieving gender equality. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, i asked the finance minister whom he directed to dispose of his shares and the only person he named was the ethics commissioner, but to my knowledge, the ethics commissioner is not a licensed stock broker and would not be the appropriate person to sell stocks on behalf of any member of cabinet, so i presume that he had his own stock broker. eos sos i wonder if he could tell us, did he ever discuss the timing or price of the sale of his $10.2-million in shares that he sold before introducing his tax measures? eos","sos no, mr. speaker. eos"
"sos the party is now saying that that money came from a fundraising event that was held in british columbia at the end of june. eos sos since when are fundraising events for papineau held 5,000kilometres away from montreal? eos","sos mr. speaker, these assertions are entirely false, as confirmed by the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner. eos sos not only that, but the liberal party has moved forward with the strongest standards in federal politics for openness and transparency, including facilitating media coverage, advance postings, posting them in publicly accessible spaces, and the timely reporting of event details and guest lists. eos"
"sos then, by sheer coincidence, within 48hours of the bank getting approved, $70,000 was deposited into the bank account of the liberal riding of papineau by wealthy chinese individuals from vancouver. eos sos if that was not a way to return the favour, then what was it? eos","sos mr. speaker, the facts are that the liberal party has moved forward with the strongest standards in federal politics for openness and transparency, which includes facilitating media coverage, advance postings, posting in publicly accessible spaces, and timely reporting of event details and guest lists. eos sos contrast that with the opposition parties who continue to organize their fundraising events in secret, barring journalists, and hiding details about who is attending their closed-door events. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, perhaps just a little sense of things that do and do not move markets. eos sos when one talks about something for six months, when one announces to 36 million canadians that one is going to make a change on the top 1%, that would be something we would describe as fully and completely disclosed, much like all of my assets were fully and completely disclosed. eos","sos mr. speaker, if one read the liberal platform, one would think that measure was going to come into effect at the beginning of april. eos sos in fact, no revenue was projected in that platform until the beginning of april. eos"
sos he should be willing to say it outside the house. eos sos we are looking forward to hearing it. eos,"sos mr. speaker, over the past few days the minister of finance has challenged us to ask our questions both inside and outside the house. eos sos the question i am going to ask him is one that i just asked in the foyer barely five minutes ago. eos"
"sos what i can say is that i have answered every question in the house. eos sos if he has something to say or to allege, he should say what he means here and in the foyer too. eos","sos mr. speaker, i am not sure he is listening, so let us try again. eos sos let me repeat inside the house what i just said outside the house. eos"
"sos number one, we told 36 million canadians that we were planning on raising taxes. eos sos number two, of course no one outside the closed circle within the department of finance and those who needed to know within our government would have known about our actions in advance of that date. eos","sos mr. speaker, in answer to one of my colleagues, the minister said earlier that the finance minister's fiscal measures affect the stock market, and i believe it. eos sos he said the market went up after the budget was tabled. eos"
"sos what i can say is that, in the end, our measures are great for canada and for canadians. eos sos we will continue to work for them. eos","sos mr. speaker, i want to thank the minister of finance. eos sos he has just answered, for the first time in this house, the question that we have been asking him for weeks, namely whether he was the person who sold shares in his family business, morneau shepell, on november30,2015. eos"
sos the hon. eos sos minister of finance. eos,"sos mr. speaker, let me be absolutely clear. eos sos i gave direction to sell shares when i came into office, to arrange my affairs. eos"
"sos instead, he has given non-answers and is trying to bully us with threats of dispatching his pricey bay street lawyers. eos sos if the finance minister will not come clean and answer the simple question if he sold 680,000 shares in morneau shepell two years ago on this day, then he needs to resign. eos","sos mr. speaker, i do hope that we will get to some questions that matter to canadians. eos sos i have answered questions about this on numerous occasions. eos"
sos the finance minister has refused to answer simple questions. eos sos how can canadians have any confidence at all in the finance minister? eos,"sos mr. speaker, let us be clear. eos sos there are no secrets here. eos"
"sos our parliamentary leader requested the list of candidates so we could engage in something called real consultation. eos sos will the government share the list of candidates for both appointments with the opposition, yes or no? eos","sos mr. speaker, when it comes to official languages in general as well as bilingualism, it goes without saying that the ndp has lost all credibility. eos sos the ndp is now trying to undermine the credibility of the new commissioner of official languages. eos"
"sos i will repeat my simple question. eos sos will the government share the list of members of the selection committee and the people on the list of finalists, yes or no? eos","sos mr. speaker, we consulted the leaders of the recognized parties on the matter of appointments, including the appointment of the lobbying commissioner. eos sos once her appointment is approved by parliament, ms. blanger will have a seven-year term. eos"
sos could the minister of finance finally stand up and come clean with canadians? eos sos that is what they want. eos,"sos mr. speaker, i wonder if the member was listening to the minister of finance this week, because the minister repeatedly said that he sold these shares that november and december, after coming to ottawa, and that he even gave nearly $5million to charity. eos sos yes, the opposition's role is to ask questions and hold the government to account, but that does not include making personal attacks, which regrettably is what we heard in the house this week. eos"
sos we are not talking about buying a pair of socks. eos sos we are talking about 10million dollars' worth of shares. eos,"sos mr. speaker, the minister has been clear. eos sos he sold some shares that november and december. eos"
sos these non-answers simply raise more questions. eos sos why did the finance minister not take the opportunity to sell all of his shares in morneau shepell when he was first elected instead of hiding them in a numbered company in alberta? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i am trying to understand the line of reasoning. eos sos the conservatives are saying that he should have sold all of his shares, or he should not have sold all of his shares. eos"
"sos perhaps he will remember this. eos sos before he made his late november 2015 sale of those 680,000 shares, did the minister clear it with the ethics commissioner first? eos","sos mr. speaker, the conservatives forgot, for 10 years, to grow the economy and to take care of the middle class. eos sos that is something the finance minister has done remarkably well in the last two years, creating 600,000 jobs and growing our economy at the fastest pace in the g7. eos"
"sos i will make it easy. eos sos can the minister confirm if the number of shares he gave instructions to sell was in fact 680,000? eos","sos mr. speaker, the finance minister has said time and time again in this house that he sold shares when he took office, when he arrived in ottawa, and that he has always worked, as well, with the ethics commissioner to make sure that all the rules are followed. eos sos he followed her recommendations to the letter when she said to put in place a conflict of interest screen. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, there have been multiple issues with the finance minister: not having his assets in a blind trust after he said he did and would; controlling assets in numbered companies; not declaring a french corporation; introducing bill c-27, for which he is now under investigation, a pension change that could directly affect his company; and now, this share issue. eos sos why can the finance minister not see how canadians find it hard to trust him after he has broken their trust? eos","sos mr. speaker, i think the 600,000 canadians who have gotten jobs over the last two years as a result of the work of this government, of this finance minister, who has created the conditions for prosperity for all in this country, would have the utmost confidence in the finance minister. eos sos some hon. eos"
"sos the hon. eos sos parliamentary secretary has, i believe, another 22 seconds. eos","sos mr. speaker, i would also think that the some 20,000 children in my riding whose families receive more money through the canada child benefit, which has lifted 300,000 kids out of poverty, would have the utmost confidence in the finance minister. eos sos he is taking care of the real needs of canadians, while the opposition is playing politics, as it always does. eos"
"sos yesterday, in question period, the minister still said that he does not know when he sold his shares. eos sos how is that possible? eos","sos mr. speaker, the minister has said that he sold some shares when he arrived in ottawa. eos sos that was during that period of november and december. eos"
sos the sale was really about divestment. eos sos can the minister explain why he held one million shares in morneau shepell until one month ago? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the minister has always been clear that he sold some shares, and has never denied it, when he took office in ottawa. eos sos the shares of morneau shepell have gone up since that day. eos"
"sos we know that the finance minister did not hold his stock in a blind trust, so he had direct control of his shares. eos sos did the finance minister ask the ethics commissioner for permission to sell those shares? eos","sos mr. speaker, when we think that the opposition could not go any lower, it does. eos sos now it is trying to implicate the finance minister's father, and i think that is disgraceful. eos"
"sos never again will we let the prime minister and the minister of finance bully us and refuse to answer questions. eos sos will the minister wait until a commission of inquiry finds out what he did, or will he do the only honourable thing he can at this point and resign? eos","sos mr. speaker, i have the utmost respect for the opposition member, who is from my region. eos sos yes, the opposition's job is to ask questions, to ask the government tough questions, but it is not the opposition's job to engage in personal attacks that have no basis in fact. eos"
sos organizations have been closing their doors for lack of funding. eos sos will the government commit to spending the money where it promised to spend it? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i fundamentally reject the notion that the department of justice has hidden any report. eos sos we have been transparent in all manner of appointments and all manner of providing support to legal aid clinics. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, today i stand in recognition of world aids day, a day whereby we can all work together to reduce the stigma of this tragic illness and provide support to those affected by it. eos sos can the minister of health please inform this house about what actions our government is taking to address hiv and aids in canada? eos","sos mr. speaker, i want to thank my colleague from hamilton eaststoney creek for this important question and for his important advocacy on this issue. eos sos world aids day is a reminder that hiv/aids remains a persistent health issue around the world, and our government is deeply committed to addressing it. eos"
"sos i ask again. eos sos knowing this, will the prime minister reverse his decision to delete listing fgm as a crime from canada's citizenship guide? eos","sos mr. speaker, female genital mutilation is an abhorrent and unacceptable practice, and it is against the law. eos sos canada has and will continue to make efforts to prevent and address fgm, and through our gender-based violence strategy, front-line service providers will have the resources to better respond to the needs of survivors of gender-based violence, including survivors of female genital mutilation. eos"
"sos part of combatting this prevention needs to be arming women with knowledge of their rights, especially those who are new to canada. eos sos will the prime minister reverse his decision to delete listing fgm as a crime from canada's citizenship guide? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government committed to completely revamping the conservatives' citizenship guide because it did not accurately and completely represent canadians. eos sos the minister is holding broader consultations with a wider range of stakeholders, including national indigenous organizations and experts on the subject. eos"
"sos they have been waiting, we have been asking. eos sos will the minister stand up and tell us today if she is going to charge them capital gains on the salvage of timber? eos","sos mr. speaker, we recognize that the canadians affected by wildfires, especially in british columbia, are facing challenges. eos sos the canada revenue agency is committed to helping them and easing their burden. eos"
"sos i have a simple question. eos sos will private property owners who have lost everything and now must salvage the timber off of their property be faced with capital gains taxes, yes or no? eos","sos mr. speaker, we recognize that canadians affected by wildfires, especially in british columbia, are facing challenges. eos sos the canada revenue agency is committed to providing taxpayer relief in the event of natural disasters, such as the b.c. eos"
"sos it is now december1, and there are only two weeks left in the session. eos sos can the minister promise that she will table her vision before the end of the parliamentary session? eos","sos mr. speaker, this government has kept its promise to continue the moratorium on the switch to community mailboxes across the country. eos sos two important reports have been prepared. eos"
"sos [translation] at the same time, the prime minister acknowledged that there was still work to do, in particular with respect to the over-criminalization of hiv non-disclosure. eos sos [english] could the parliamentary secretary to the minister of justice and attorney general tell the house about actions being taken to address this serious issue? eos","sos mr. speaker, i thank the member for west nova for his question and his excellent work. eos sos we all have a duty to work on reducing the discrimination and stigmatization of people living with hiv. eos"

"sos now we learn that people suffering with autism are losing the disability tax credit, a tax increase of $1,500 for families that are suffering with great hardship. eos sos whenever liberals raise taxes, why do they always target those with the least? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government pledged that the agency would administer measures for persons with disabilities in a fair, transparent, and accessible way. eos sos i was proud to announce that the disability advisory committee, which was disbanded by the former conservative government in 2006, was being reinstated. eos"
"sos they have ended federal funding to ngos, obstructed important tools for police that were adopted by this house, and have introduced legislation to block consecutive sentencing for sex traffickers. eos sos when will the liberal government step up and start fighting this horrific form of modern-day slavery? eos","sos mr. speaker, human trafficking is abhorrent, and we must do everything within our power to stop it. eos sos that is why we work with our domestic and international partners to protect victims and to ensure we do everything we can to stop this practice. eos"

sos an ndp motion on pay equity was adopted in the house almost a year ago and the government has yet to do anything about it. eos sos when will the government acknowledge pay equity as a right and rectify this injustice? eos,"sos mr. speaker, it is a great day for jobs and employment in canada. eos sos canadians have created over 600,000 jobs since we have taken office, almost 80,000 this month alone. eos"
"sos an important principle of that democracy is that everyone has an equal opportunity to run for office. eos sos [english] can the parliamentary secretary to the minister of democratic institutions update this house on the government's response to the court of queen's bench of alberta ruling on the $1,000 deposit for federal election candidates? eos","sos mr. speaker, i thank my colleague from ottawavanier for her question and for the good work that she does. eos sos [english] we believe in a vibrant and inclusive democratic process in which more canadians, not fewer, should be able to participate. eos"

"sos what we did not know was that, in the space of 48 hours, the prime minister received $70,000 from wealthy chinese individuals in vancouver for his liberal riding association. eos sos if that is not payback, then what is? eos","sos mr. speaker, as i have said in the house many times, we have some of the strictest rules when it comes to fundraising in our country. eos sos the assertions that the member is making are entirely false, as confirmed by the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner. eos"
sos does the minister know the difference between the money identified and the money recovered? eos sos how much credibility does the minister have when she utters such nonsense that her own department does not know what she is talking about? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government is fully committed to combatting tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. eos sos the cra has an effective recovery process. eos"
"sos there are two different stories, but the same incompetence. eos sos does the minister know what she is talking about? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government pledged that the canada revenue agency would administer measures for persons with disabilities in a fair, transparent, and accessible way. eos sos i was proud to announce that the disability advisory committee, which was disbanded by the former conservative government in 2006, was being reinstated. eos"
sos he has also said in the house that he gave the transaction records to a journalist. eos sos how is it possible that a journalist knows the date on which he sold the shares but he does not? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the minister has never denied it. eos sos he has always been clear that he did sell shares when he came to office in november 2015. i wonder what the member is alleging. eos"
"sos the minister said that there was no coordination in this matter between him and his father. eos sos did they use the same stock brokerage firm, yes or no? eos","sos mr. speaker, let me quote something else i read recently in the papers. eos sos the financial post said, the attacks on [the finance minister] ethics are beginning to look unethical in themselves. eos"
"sos unfortunately, low-income people suffering from diabetes do not have access to the same kind of sophisticated tax manoeuvres the minister used. eos sos why does the liberal government continue to raise taxes on those with the least while letting the wealthy get off scot-free? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government pledged that the cra would administer measures for persons with disabilities in a fair, transparent, and accessible way. eos sos last week, i was proud to announce that the disability advisory committee, which our colleagues opposite disbanded in 2006 when they were in government, was being reinstated. eos"

"sos we now know, through an internal document released by atip today, that an internal cra memo, sent to dozens of officials, urged those officials to reject all diabetics for the tax credit, except in exceptional circumstances. eos sos why did the minister mislead the house? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government is implementing important measures to help the most vulnerable canadians. eos sos in 2015-16, our government invested more than $41million in diabetes research. eos"
"sos she stated in the house falsehoods, and her department has raised taxes on the most vulnerable people in the country. eos sos why? eos","sos mr. speaker, all canadians must receive the tax credits to which they are entitled. eos sos no changes have been made to the eligibility criteria for the disability tax credit. eos"
"sos in committee, the ndp proposed six amendments to the bill based on expert testimony. eos sos will the government finally listen to canadians' concerns, accept our amendments, and fix the flaws in this bill? eos","sos mr. speaker, my colleague opposite is well aware that committees manage their own affairs. eos sos as a government, we are keeping our election promise to join the arms trade treaty. eos"
"sos however, canada has remained silent on the role of saudi arabia in this conflict and continues to sell arms to that country, making it potentially complicit in the conflict. eos sos when will canada show moral leadership and suspend the sale of arms to saudi arabia? eos","sos mr. speaker, we are absolutely committed to an export control system that is rigorous, that is transparent, and that is predictable. eos sos our government is taking steps to further strengthen the export regime. eos"

sos the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner is meeting with the minister of finance to ask him the same questions we are asking. eos sos will the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner also be threatened with legal action? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner represents an independent and impartial institution, unlike the opposition, which is acting as judge and jury. eos sos we trust the ethics commissioner, with whom the minister of finance has been working from the beginning to make sure he is in full compliance with the rules that guide us in the house. eos"
"sos the question is simple: will the minister of finance finally get serious about collaborating with the ethics commissioner? eos sos instead of keeping this between himself and the ethics commissioner, why does the minister of finance not publicly say whether he was the one who sold those 680,000 shares? eos","sos mr. speaker, to the question about whether the minister of finance will work with the ethics commissioner the answer is yes, he always has and always will. eos sos as far as the sale of shares is concerned, the minister of finance has never denied that he sold shares when he arrived in ottawa in november2015. eos"

"sos actions matter more than words. eos sos therefore, if the government is serious about reconciliation, will it apologize to chef francis and act to honour undrip? eos","sos mr. speaker, of course in the context of canada 150 we made sure to support the importance of reconciliation. eos sos we know that our history has had some wrongs and we want to make sure that we can acknowledge them and make sure that we all work together on the path of reconciliation. eos"

"sos if the minister of finance put as much energy into supporting our business people as he does into managing his personal finances, things would be totally different. eos sos if he cannot do his job properly, he should vacate the position for someone else. eos","sos mr. speaker, we believe the minister of finance is doing an exceptional job, and i hope my colleague will be satisfied with the economic results we have obtained. eos sos for example, the canadian economy created nearly 600,000 jobs over the past two years, most of them full-time, and the unemployment rate dropped to 5.9%, its lowest point in a decade. eos"

"sos canadians need to know they can trust the country's chief financial officer, but they have lost trust in the minister. eos sos will he do the right thing and resign? eos","sos mr. speaker, i fully understand why the conservatives want to talk about anything but the economy. eos sos when we look at growth in the country, in the last two years the average growth has been twice as high as they had in their years in power. eos"
"sos he is under investigation by the ethics commissioner for having forgotten to declare a villa in europe and for having introduced a bill that benefits his company, morneau shepell. eos sos when will the prime minister decide that the finance minister should resign? eos","sos mr. speaker, as i said many times in the house, and as the member for beauce knows, the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner is the institution responsible for preserving the integrity of parliament. eos sos the finance minister has always worked and always will work with her to ensure that all the rules that govern us are respected at all times. eos"
"sos these changes will take effect very early in 2018. we have lost confidence, and business owners have lost confidence in the minister of finance. eos sos when will the minister of finance resign? eos","sos mr. speaker, the minister of finance's record is clear. eos sos nearly 600,000 jobs have been added to the economy. eos"

"sos at yesterday's standing committee on official languages meeting, we heard that the commissioner's new mandate did not really seem to have the teeth to ensure the principles of bilingualism are properly enforced. eos sos will the liberals commit to giving the commissioner of official languages adequate power and resources to ensure the vitality of french and english across the country? eos","sos mr. speaker, we recognize the importance of our two official languages and the importance of our french-canadian youth. eos sos i was actually at the jeux de la francophonie canadienne, which the department of canadian heritage supports every year. eos"
"sos that is like asking a football team to play an entire game under a new set of rules, but not telling the new rules until half-time. eos sos can the minister explain how he expects small businesses to operate under these conditions? eos","sos mr. speaker, as the leader of the opposition knows, one of the important things small business owners across the country know is that our government has lowered the small business tax, which will benefit thousands and thousands of corporations and create, we believe, hundreds of thousands of jobs for middle-class canadians. eos sos that is something we committed to in the last election campaign. eos"
sos what kind of good news can small business owners expect? eos sos will the good news be that the government is scrapping its tax hikes? eos,"sos mr. speaker, one thing we can tell the leader of the opposition is that not many small business owners i have met believe that phony 73% figure he keeps throwing around in the house of commons. eos sos one thing canadians know is that our government is committed to supporting small businesses. eos"
"sos the tax reform we are hearing about is to come into effect in a few days, on january 1, and no one knows the details. eos sos when will the liberal government provide business people, who create jobs, with the details of this reform? eos","sos mr. speaker, i do not wish to correct my hon. eos sos colleague, but what we announced during the summer was that we would consult canadians. eos"
"sos canadians are worried, entrepreneurs are worried, and canadian workers across the country are worried. eos sos when will the government tell job-creating entrepreneurs what is going on? eos","sos mr. speaker, my hon. eos sos colleague mentioned canadian workers. eos"
sos what is going on? eos sos when will the government be clear with canadians and reveal its china trade list of priorities? eos,"sos mr. speaker, canada has always been a trading nation, and access to diversified, growing markets is critical for growing our economy and creating good jobs. eos sos as we have said from the beginning, if we decide to strengthen our economic engagement with china, we will do so on our own terms, based on our interests, safeguarding our values, and at our own speed. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, according to a report commissioned by global affairs canada, trade with china was responsible for the loss of 105,000 jobs in canada between 2001 and 2011. now that the government appears to be in such a rush to enter into formal negotiations for a free trade agreement with china, does the government have any idea how many canadian jobs will be at risk if we go ahead with a free trade agreement with china? eos","sos mr. speaker, as canadians are well aware, reaching successful trade agreements is no small feat and is a time-consuming process. eos sos canadians also understand how important it is to do things right and move forward on our discussions. eos"
"sos we are still waiting for an answer. eos sos if the minister of finance is unable to answer our simple, softball questions, then i would ask him to issue a press release announcing his immediate resignation. eos","sos mr. speaker, first of all, the minister of finance has successfully grown our economy at a remarkable rate over the past two years, so no, he will certainly not be resigning. eos sos as minister of finance, he has done what needed to be done for canadians, not only by lowering the small business tax rate from 11% to 9% by 2019, but also by stimulating the economy to create 600,000 jobs in two years. eos"
sos that is irresponsible for our children and grandchildren. eos sos when will the minister of finance resign? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i thank my colleague from beauce for his question. eos sos it gives me an opportunity to remind members that when we were elected in 2015, our debt-to-gdp ratio was 32.5%. eos"
"sos when asked simply if he as minister signed the memorandum approving bill c-27, he refused to answer. eos sos if the minister refuses to be transparent about something as simple as this, will he not just resign? eos","sos no, mr. speaker, the finance minister will not resign, because the finance minister has delivered more for the canadian economy and canadians than those members ever did in 10 years. eos sos we are talking about close to 600,000 jobs created in the last two years, most of them full time. eos"
sos why will the minister not answer this simple question? eos sos was he the one who signed the memo to approve bill c-27? eos,"sos mr. speaker, to answer the member's question, i believe that constitutes cabinet confidence. eos sos on another note, though, i will say that the finance minister over the last two years has done amazingly well at growing this economy. eos"
sos there is a difference between money identified and money recovered. eos sos how can canadians believe the minister when her own administration does not know what she is talking about? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government is fully committed to fighting tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. eos sos the revenue agency has a very effective recovery process, which was strengthened by our investments of close to $1 billion. eos"
"sos can the minister tell us whether the prime minister had access to confidential information from the canada revenue agency? eos sos if so, when will he face the consequences? eos","sos mr. speaker, as my colleague knows very well, i will not comment on a specific case, not today, not tomorrow, not ever. eos sos the law prohibits me from doing so. eos"
sos the minister refuses to come clean about the contents of his other numbered companies. eos sos how many ethics investigations will it take before the minister just does the right thing and resigns? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the finance minister, as is expected of all ministers and parliamentarians, has worked with the ethics commissioner. eos sos we have the utmost trust in the ethics commissioner to set the path forward for parliamentarians, which she has done with the minister of finance. eos"
"sos he is now the subject of a comprehensive investigation by the ethics commissioner because he introduced a bill that could benefit his family company. eos sos considering all of these developments, will the minister of finance do the right thing and resign? eos","sos mr. speaker, the tax policy the member mentioned, which was announced on december 7, 2015, is one that we are proud of. eos sos we increased taxes for the wealthiest 1% so we could lower them for nine million middle-class canadians. eos"
"sos he has hid the fact that he was sheltering and controlling millions of shares in a numbered alberta company. eos sos if he has done nothing wrong, why is the minister refusing to answer simple questions about his behaviour? eos","sos mr. speaker, the finance minister has worked with the ethics commissioner and answered all of her questions. eos sos he will always work with the ethics commissioner to make sure all of the rules are followed, so he can continue the important work he has been doing the last two years, which has been to grow the economy at twice the growth the conservative party was able to achieve in the 10 years it was in power, creating more jobs than it ever could in their time in office. eos"
"sos with a record like that, there is only one thing left for the minister to do, and that is resign. eos sos why will he not? eos","sos mr. speaker, it is becoming quite obvious that the opposition want to talk about anything else but the economy. eos sos when we talk about the economy and this government's record, it makes the conservatives' record pale in comparison. eos"
"sos [english] as climate change changes our landscapes and ecosystems, we have a responsibility to protect them now more than ever. eos sos could the minister of fisheries, oceans and the canadian coast guard please update the house on what the government is doing to protect the high seas of the central arctic ocean? eos","sos mr. speaker, last week, canada reached a historic agreement in principle with our international partners to prevent unregulated commercial fishing in the high seas of the central arctic ocean. eos sos this is the first time an international agreement of this magnitude has been reached before any commercial fishing takes place on a region of the high seas. eos"
"sos in the two-minute meeting that the minister was willing to offer her, ms. mccrea asked him why ottawa was continuing to fight sick women, and he replied,  well, ms. mccrea, that is the old question, like asking ...

"sos for a feminist government that claims men must take responsibility for their actions against women, how does the minister justify blaming this young mom for his condescending words? eos sos is this not victim blaming at its finest? eos","sos mr. speaker, i recognize 100% that my comments were inappropriate, and i apologize profusely for them. eos sos i will continue to work on trying to improve both my individual self and myself as a parliamentarian. eos"
"sos the minister for persons with disabilities is refusing to help, and worse yet, belittling those who dare ask. eos sos does the minister understand that canadians who reach out to him for help do not expect to be attacked for simply asking for it? eos","sos mr. speaker, as a parliamentarian, i know my job is to meet with constituents and stakeholders across the country and work as hard as i can to represent their issues. eos sos i try to represent their interests in a real and fair manner. eos"
sos it is well past time the government listens to experts. eos sos will the minister work with the british columbia government to protect steelhead before it is too late? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we share my colleague's concern with respect to steelhead salmon. eos sos i have had the opportunity on a number of occasions to discuss that with the government of british columbia. eos"
sos many of these species are relied on by indigenous communities and other communities for their survival. eos sos will even more court actions be needed to trigger government action on its duty to protect threatened species? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government is committed to protecting all species at risk, including pacific salmon. eos sos we have worked with environment and climate change canada and the province of british columbia to implement something that i know is very important to my colleagues from british columbia, 64 of the 75 recommendations of the cohen commission. eos"
sos we are working with our partners to move their priorities forward and challenging them to be innovative in both the projects they put forward and how they think about community improvement planning resulting in community building. eos sos can the minister of infrastructure and communities please update this house on the government's latest challenge to canadian communities? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i recently launched the smart cities challenge in calgary, encouraging communities to work together to improve the lives of the residents through innovation, data, and connected technologies. eos sos we are encouraging our partners to be bold and innovative, and participate in the smart cities challenge in order to build stronger, more sustainable, and inclusive communities, and create jobs and a more thriving economy. eos"
"sos everyone is expecting her to get things back on track. eos sos will the minister of canadian heritage and the minister of finance stop passing the buck, admit that they made a mistake, and reconsider these unfair handouts? eos","sos mr. speaker, our colleague opposite refuses to talk about creative canada, our new cultural policy. eos sos that is because the conservatives know that it lines up perfectly with our election promises, which were much more ambitious than theirs, and because they know that we are investing additional billions in culture, something they never could have done. eos"
"sos too many live-in caregivers are waiting far too long for their families, while they care for ours. eos sos could the minister of immigration tell the house what he is doing to reunite caregivers with their families? eos","sos mr. speaker, i want to thank the hon. eos sos member for don valley west for his question. eos"

"sos mr. speaker, i have a question for the government, which will hopefully be answered a little better than the questions were answered in question period, but we will see how that goes. eos sos i would ask the parliamentary secretary to the leader of the government in the house of commons what the government has planned for the rest of this week and next week before we go back to our ridings for the christmas break. eos","sos mr. speaker, this afternoon, we will continue the report stage debate of bill c-24, the one-tier ministry bill. eos sos tomorrow, we shall commence second reading debate of bill c-66, the expungement of historically unjust convictions act. eos"
sos the liberal government appears to be making this up as it goes along. eos sos will the foreign affairs minister rise in this house today and tell us why the prime minister is contradicting her chief negotiator? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our negotiating position is clear and always has been. eos sos we will defend the elements of nafta that canadians know are essential to our national interests . eos"
"sos it is not surprising that the minister of national revenue would go after the most vulnerable when the other minister, the one who is supposed to defend them, makes fun of them when they reach out for help. eos sos who in this cabinet is going to clean up this mess and give vulnerable people their dignity and their money back? eos","sos mr.speaker, i invite my colleague to repeat the same thing outside the house after question period. eos sos i invite him to tell me that i did not respect my diabetic husband, whom i stood by until his final days. eos"

"sos there is no written legislation, there are no written rules, but businesses are now scrambling right before the christmas break to determine what the laws will be. eos sos how is that reasonable? eos","sos mr. speaker, i want to reassure the member that the details will be known very shortly. eos sos i also want to highlight what the finance minister has also announced, which is a reduction in the small business tax rate from 10.5% to 9%. eos"
"sos reasonable to it is raising taxes on people with diabetes, on waitresses enjoying a small sandwich during their break, on autistic people, on farmers, and on small businesses. eos sos how can the government expect small businesses to have faith that the government will be reasonable in its treatment of family compensation? eos","sos mr. speaker, it is quite the contrary. eos sos we lowered taxes for small businesses, from 11% to 10.5%, and now to 9% by 2019. because we recognize the importance of small businesses in canada, we will always be behind our entrepreneurs. eos"
"sos however, because he is up to his eyeballs in these troubles, he is unable to do his job, which is to answer questions and tell people what the rules will be. eos sos if he cannot do the work of a finance minister, why will he not step aside and let someone else do it for him? eos","sos mr. speaker, i recognize this is friday and the member for carleton is sometimes a bit careless with facts. eos sos when we talk about the measures announced on december 7, it was not deemed market moving. eos"
sos every day that goes by means that entrepreneurs and job creators have one less day to prepare. eos sos can the government at least tell us that the new measures will be presented next week at the latest so that we can finally debate them here in the house? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i can assure my colleague that the measures will soon be presented, along with the details on how they will affect income sprinkling. eos sos canadians and entrepreneurs will find out about these measures very soon. eos"
"sos this bad government would also have made business people pay much more if they wanted to sell their companies to their children. eos sos will the government pledge to introduce the new measures as quickly as possible, at least next week, so that our entrepreneurs can adequately prepare? eos","sos mr. speaker, yes, we pledge to do that. eos sos the details will be made available very soon. eos"

sos will the government divide bill c-59 into separate bills so they can be properly studied? eos sos canadians' rights are at stake. eos,"sos mr. speaker, bill c-59 was preceded by the most exhaustive public consultation across canada ever on national security. eos sos there was an opportunity by the public safety and national security committee to ensure there was a review of the security framework. eos"
sos the liberals must work with the provinces instead of simply imposing changes. eos sos when will the government honour its commitment to true partnership with the provinces? eos,"sos to the contrary, mr. speaker, we value the work we do with the provinces. eos sos we look forward to the discussions that will happen next week with the finance ministers of all provinces, as we continue to collaborate with all provinces and territories to make sure our economy is successful and thriving. eos"
sos the finance ministers are meeting this weekend. eos sos will the government finally start to treat the provinces and municipalities as partners instead of subordinates? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we have always treated the provinces as partners, and we will continue to do so. eos sos we look forward to discussions between the federal minister and his provincial counterparts. eos"
"sos the minister of finance has said that he is changing the rules on january 1, but he refuses to provide any details. eos sos just how does the minister think that giving these people less than 24 days to do their tax planning is fair, especially at christmas? eos","sos mr. speaker, it is important to highlight that our government has always been behind small businesses. eos sos we have lowered the small business tax rate from 10.5% to 9% by 2019. we believe that it is important to stimulate growth. eos"
"sos they seem to think it is fair to spend $2.2 million paying actors for their talent, but when it comes to small business owners, the liberals do not think it is fair to tell them how the tax changes are going to affect them. eos sos in the spirit of christmas, will the minister tell them what to expect so that they can plan for the new year? eos","sos mr. speaker, as i have mentioned time and time again, the details will come very shortly. eos sos what is a foreign concept to the opposition is probably the concept of tax fairness, in and of itself. eos"
"sos while we all joyfully celebrate christmas and the new year, some people will be feeling somewhat less celebratory about these tax hikes. eos sos will the government share the details of the tax hike with canada's entrepreneurs before the new year? eos","sos yes, mr. speaker. eos"
sos it is one minute to midnight. eos sos will the government show some respect for canadian entrepreneurs and let them in on the new tax rules today? eos,"sos mr. speaker, details about income sprinkling will be released very shortly. eos sos we have listened to entrepreneurs and canadians from coast to coast to make sure the changes we introduce to improve tax fairness, which might be a foreign concept to the opposition, are done properly and will not have unintended consequences. eos"
"sos the government continues to make it harder for his restaurant to be successful, but it gets worse. eos sos he does not even know what changes he will face on january 1. is this minister of finance so preoccupied with his many ethical messes that he does not have the time to do his job? eos","sos mr. speaker, i think it is important to remind the member and entrepreneurs across the country that we stand behind them. eos sos that is why we have decided to lower the small business tax rate to 9% by 2019. for the employees in those businesses, we have increased the working income tax benefit by 65%, which will represent more money in their pockets while reducing taxes for the middle class. eos"
sos this leads canadians to wonder if the finance minister is too preoccupied with his ethical fiascos to do his job. eos sos why has the finance minister failed to tell us the details of his plan? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the details will be coming very shortly, in advance of the january 1 implementation date. eos sos the finance minister has been preoccupied for the last three years with growing this economy. eos"
sos how can we encourage better election participation from indigenous people if we do not have advance polls anywhere near indigenous communities? eos sos how is this part of a nation-to-nation relationship? eos,"sos mr. speaker, there is no relationship more important to this government than the relationship with our indigenous peoples. eos sos the ability to vote is fundamental to all canadians, all canadian citizens, including indigenous peoples. eos"
sos it budgeted a mere $4 million for research. eos sos why are the liberals spending more on a temporary rink outside than they spend for lyme disease sufferers? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government recognizes the impact of lyme disease on families and on canadians. eos sos we have tabled the federal framework on lyme disease in canada, which clearly lays out the federal government's role in addressing lyme disease in canada. eos"
sos they deserve answers. eos sos what actions are the liberals taking to address this issue and why do they think it is okay for people to keep waiting? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the government of canada is well aware of the seriousness of the complaints from residents in the city of windsor, where i was a couple of weeks ago with my distinguished colleagues and, of course, the resulting pain caused by the noise. eos sos we understand their concern. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, our government has set a goal of growing our agricultural exports to $75billion by 2025. the agreement between europe and canada will contribute to that goal by boosting exports by up to $1.5billion annually. eos sos could the parliamentary secretary to the minister of agriculture and agri-food tell the house about the measures our government has taken to help farmers, ranchers, and producers capitalize on this agreement and leverage export opportunities? eos","sos mr. speaker, i want to thank my colleague from glengarryprescottrussell for the great work he does on the standing committee on agriculture and agri-food. eos sos the minister headed a trade mission to europe, where he attended the world's largest food trade show, met with official representatives, and helped open doors for our beef and pork producers. eos"
"sos then, quietly, in the u.s., they tell our nafta partners that all of those progressive priorities will be non-binding. eos sos today i am going to ask the parliamentary secretary to put aside the sheet that the pmo provided him, and confirm to us today that when he and others are in the u.s., they are telling nafta stakeholders that the progressive agenda will all be non-binding. eos","sos mr. speaker, no. eos"
"sos i appeal to the minister to please answer my question. eos sos now that we know for sure that an agreement will not be reached before 2018, can she at least assure us that she will do everything in her power to save nafta, since we are at that point? eos","sos mr. speaker, our position is clear. eos sos we will defend and maintain the elements of nafta that are key to our national interests. eos"
"sos hard-working forestry families and their livelihoods are being held ransom. eos sos with only weeks to go before christmas, what is the minister planning to do and prepared to do for canadian families? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government stands firmly behind the canadian forest industry, which supports hundreds of thousands of good jobs across the country. eos sos through our softwood lumber action plan, we are investing $867 million to support workers and communities affected by these unjustified duties: to diversify markets, to create access to international markets, and provide financial services on commercial terms. eos"
"sos last week, the minister of public services and procurement promised that she would finally respond to the report before the house rises, but her director of communications backtracked yesterday, saying that the minister would respond in due time. eos sos will the minister clarify to canadians whether she will respond before the house adjourns, or will she break yet another promise? eos","sos mr. speaker, i thank my hon. eos sos colleague for the question. eos"

sos canadians know that this is completely unacceptable. eos sos will the minister commit to protect canadians by prosecuting these terrorists? eos,"sos mr. speaker, again, let me be clear. eos sos yes, of course we will go after any individual who has committed a terrorist act. eos"
"sos to do that, and i am not making this up, the liberals plan to employ methods such as poetry and podcasts. eos sos when will liberals take the public safety of canadians seriously? eos","sos mr. speaker, this government is doing exactly what the conservative government did not do; we are investing in the services that keep this country safe. eos sos need i remind the member opposite of the cuts that the harper government implemented to the very services that keep this country safe: $530 million from the rcmp; $390 million from the canada border services agency; $69 million from csis; $42 million from the communications security establishment; and $171 million from the canadian air transport security authority. eos"

"sos unions, the government, the business community, everyone is sick of hearing the minister of canadian heritage spew the federal government's empty rhetoric in quebec when she should be defending our culture in ottawa. eos sos when she meets with the board of trade of metropolitan montreal today, rather than using newspeak, will the minister stop being so condescending and finally listen to those who know our culture? eos","sos mr. speaker, we have always been clear in this regard. eos sos that being said, we have presented a cultural policy, with investments in culture. eos"
sos is it the treasury board? eos sos who is blocking the deal? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we are obviously very concerned, and we lament job losses in quebec and everywhere else. eos sos it is this government that is trying to provide the davie shipyard with opportunities in the short, medium and long terms through our national shipbuilding strategy. eos"

"sos quebec will do its share to help, but the federal government is breaking its promise and is offering only $50,000 a year, or half of what the centre needs. eos sos will the government rethink its priorities and provide an adequate subsidy to help maintain an essential service for children and families? eos","sos mr. speaker, early childhood education services are key to our economy, but also to our society. eos sos our children are our most precious resource. eos"
sos the u.s. lumber industry is enjoying record profits and canadian imports are at a lower level today than they were when deemed non-injurious by the itc in the last round of litigation. eos sos what is the government doing today to support canadian producers in their appeal of this latest american decision and when can we expect to see a long-term resolution to this ongoing battle? eos,"sos mr. speaker, as we have said throughout this dispute, punitive u.s. countervailing and anti-dumping duties on canadian softwood lumber are disturbing, troubling, and unjust. eos sos in recent weeks, we have put legal challenges against u.s. duties on canadian softwood under both nafta and the world trade organization rules. eos"

sos the ethics commissioner is so busy with the liberals that we are not certain that she will complete her investigations by the end of her term in office. eos sos will the prime minister commit to ensuring that the investigations will continue after the ethics commissioner is replaced? eos,"sos mr. speaker, as i have often said, i have recused myself from any discussion concerning the appointment of the next conflict of interest and ethics commissioner. eos sos moreover, four of my staff members have set up an ethics screen to prevent them from participating in these discussions. eos"
"sos normally a new ethics commissioner would be appointed by government after consulting with the opposition and a parliamentary committee hearing for the nominee, but the liberals are trying to ram this appointment through. eos sos if the prime minister cannot answer this himself, is there someone over there who could make the commitment that members of parliament will have the opportunity to interview the nominee for the ethics commissioner before the appointment is official? eos","sos mr. speaker, after 10 years of the kind of patronage that the previous government put forward, we put forward an independent, merit-based process for government appointments. eos sos this ensures that government appointments are not only of the highest quality, but reflect the range and scope of experiences and diversity that make canada strong. eos"

"sos however, they still have time to fix this major omission. eos sos will the minister roll up his sleeves for women and people with disabilities and bring up the subject of the canada pension plan at the finance ministers' meeting, in order to fix the flaws in this bill? eos","sos mr. speaker, i am thrilled to be part of a government that has lifted 13,000seniors out of poverty over the past few years by increasing the guaranteed income supplement. eos sos in addition, thanks to our decision to bring the age of eligibility for old age security from 67 back down to 65, 100,000seniors have been able to escape destitution. eos"

"sos the liberals claim their most important relationship is with indigenous people. eos sos therefore, when will they prove they are serious about reconciliation, end this costly prosecution of the nuu-chah-nulth people, and finally recognize their fishing rights? eos","sos mr. speaker, a renewed nation-to-nation relationship based on recognition of rights, respect, co-operation, and partnership with the indigenous peoples of canada is a top priority for our government. eos sos we are working with the five nuu-chah-nulth nations to resolve fisheries disputes and to maintain stability and operational predictability in the interests of all fishers in british columbia. eos"

"sos the people of essex are lucky to still have their community news, but if the attitude of the heritage minister, who says the liberals will not bail out local media, does not change, local newspapers will shut down in the communities of all members. eos sos how can the minister continue to sit back and do nothing when canadians are losing jobs and their news sources? eos","sos mr. speaker, our thoughts are with the workers and their families affected by the cuts in the print media industry. eos sos canadians value local news, and our government will continue to support it. eos"

"sos even the australians cannot understand why we are buying their old planes rather than doing what they are doing, which is buying new planes. eos sos if the prime minister is so keen on buying fixer-uppers, will he come over, because i have an old minivan i would love to show him? eos","sos mr. speaker, canadians know that the previous conservative government failed over the course of 10 years to give the men and women of our armed forces the equipment necessary to do their jobs. eos sos it so completely botched the fighter jet procurement
              
                some hon. eos"
sos the right hon. eos sos prime minister has the floor. eos,"sos mr. speaker, the previous conservative government made such a mess of buying the needed fighter jets that we can no longer meet our norad and nato obligations, which is why we need an interim fleet replacement while we proceed to the open and transparent competition that it should have held almost a decade ago. eos"
"sos public servants and unions have been speaking out about the system for two years now, but nothing much has been done to fix this fiasco. eos sos is the government waiting for all public servants to be affected before it takes action and finds a solution? eos","sos mr. speaker, resolving this situation is my top priority. eos sos it is unacceptable that people are not being paid. eos"
"sos the liberals' inaction is not only affecting our public servants, it is also hurting our charities. eos sos how much has the ongoing phoenix mess cost charities this year? eos","sos mr. speaker, let me assure the member that resolving this is my top priority. eos sos we understand the difficult position we have put public servants and their families in, and we are leaving no stone unturned to make sure that we resolve this as quickly as possible. eos"

"sos however, after dragging their feet for months, they appointed a second official languages commissioner because the first one was too partisan, a lobbying commissioner who had actually applied for the position of information commissioner, and a conflict of interest and ethics commissioner who has already been severely rebuked by the auditor general. eos sos how can the prime minister tell canadians that these are the best candidates when the process is so flawed? eos","sos mr. speaker, we established a merit-based appointment process for choosing officers of parliament and making government appointments that better reflect the diversity and quality of what canadians have to offer. eos sos after 10 years of partisanship, we are proud of the process we have created, and we have great confidence in all our appointments. eos"
sos this is what he calls a consultation. eos sos could the prime minister show some transparency and tell canadians who was on the selection committee and who the candidates were? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i beg to differ. eos sos we have built all kinds of transparency mechanisms into our appointment processes so the public can have confidence in the process. eos"
"sos canadians are starting to worry that this prime minister does not even care. eos sos for a prime minister who is actually under an ethics investigation, does he finally understand that we need a credible process to hire the watchdogs who work on behalf of all of us? eos","sos mr. speaker, nominating an officer of parliament is an extremely important process that we are glad we have engaged in with the members of the opposition. eos sos we will continue to consult and ensure that the highest quality of people come forward, and are encouraged to apply, to make sure that our officers of parliament, and indeed, nominations across the government, whether it be senators or supreme court justices, reflect the full skills and diversity this country has to offer. eos"
"sos they work for parliament on behalf of all canadians. eos sos will he pull the names, restart the process, and finally show a little respect for this place? eos","sos mr. speaker, it is important that the officers of parliament have the confidence of this house. eos sos if the officers of parliament we have appointed do not have the confidence of the new democratic party, let it say so. eos"
sos it seems the official opposition cannot take a position. eos sos could the minister clearly reiterate the government's position on net neutrality in canada? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i was wondering if the leader of the official opposition could provide clarification on what its position is, because the member for beauce, who is the official innovation critic said one thing and the member for parry soundmuskoka says he disagrees with him. eos sos let me be clear. eos"
"sos my office has been trying to reach someone since february to clean up this phoenix mess, which comes on top of so many others, but nobody even acknowledges our communications. eos sos when will the minister help ms. boisvert and admit that her pay system is broken beyond repair? eos","sos mr. speaker, we are doing our best to make things better for public servants who are suffering because of phoenix. eos sos people not getting paid is unacceptable. eos"
"sos even while working hard to help canadians celebrate canada 150, they found themselves going months without proper paycheques. eos sos adding even more injury to this insult, these workers have been without a contract since 2014. when will the government fix this phoenix fiasco for our public servants, and when will it show parks canada employees respect by bringing a fair offer to the bargaining table? eos","sos mr. speaker, we have tremendous respect for the important work done by our hard-working public servants. eos sos we have actually re-established a culture of respect for our public servants. eos"
"sos i want to give the prime minister an opportunity to correct the record. eos sos will he admit that his minister has not apologized, and will he start showing kim davis the respect that she deserves? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government takes very seriously the responsibility of responding to canadians' concerns and helping our veterans and helping canadians with disabilities, and we will continue to. eos sos the minister responded to those particular allegations and he apologized for earlier ones. eos"
sos when will the minister show some compassion? eos sos when will he take responsibility for what he did and show that he is worthy of his title? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government is committed to improving the lives of veterans and their families. eos sos we are aware of the concerns of ms. davis. eos"
sos why did the minister order his staff to publicly humiliate kim davis instead of telling them to do their jobs and help veterans and their families? eos sos why is the pm okay with it? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i met with kim davis some two years ago, and i thanked her and her husband for their tremendous service to our country. eos sos i went to the fact that our government was increasing financial security, that our government was opening offices, that our government was improving their lives, that our government was going to improve the outcome of the caregiver benefit. eos"

"sos the liberals keep telling my office that the case is under third-party escalation, but there have been no changes and absolutely no help for this woman. eos sos when will this minister stop blaming the conservatives and fix this shameful mess the liberals have made? eos","sos mr. speaker, we are completely committed to resolving phoenix. eos sos fixing this is my number one priority. eos"
sos can the hon. eos sos minister of indigenous services please update this house as to what is being done on jordan's principle. eos,"sos mr. speaker, 10 years ago today in this house, a motion was passed in honour of jordan river anderson, a first nations child who was denied access to care because of jurisdictional disputes. eos sos after almost a decade of inaction, we are making sure that no first nations child goes through what jordan did. eos"
"sos after two years, we have a lot of liberal promises but little action. eos sos will this minister finally commit to a real, immediate, and fair redress system so that parents can travel with their children this christmas? eos","sos mr. speaker, the research reports today are highly speculative, but the point is simply this. eos sos we are dealing with a flawed system that was implemented about 10 years ago by the previous government, and we are trying very hard to fix that system. eos"

"sos however, as we saw at yesterday's meeting with the minister of finance, no one from anywhere else in canada wanted to address the issue. eos sos is the minister of canadian heritage jeopardizing our distinct culture in the name of the canadian consensus? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government recognizes the importance of protecting culture and that is why we are taking concrete action. eos sos we have invested $2.3billion, the largest investment in 30 years by the federal government, in our creative industries and the protection and support of the production of french and english content. eos"
"sos this minister, in typical fashion, is now denying any responsibility and is blaming the widow for his comments. eos sos can the prime minister tell us who he believes: the veteran's widow or this minister? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government takes the concerns of canadians very seriously. eos sos we have been working over the past two years to deliver to veterans and their families the kinds of support they need and deserve and, quite frankly, they did not get for 10 years under the conservative government. eos"
"sos no one can put nuance around the violent removal of a woman's clitoris, and if they try to, we should not listen to them. eos sos will the minister end his consultations and decide today that warnings about fgm belong in canada's citizenship guide? eos","sos mr. speaker, i agree with the member opposite that fgm is an abhorrent practice. eos sos it is against the laws of canada. eos"
"sos once again today, the government has made an announcement that does not address the serious concerns of the business owners who create jobs in our communities. eos sos how can the prime minister allow this incompetence and this farce to carry on, when january 1st is fast approaching? eos","sos mr. speaker, on january 1st, every single one of our small businesses will see their taxes cut. eos sos this is good news for the middle class and for those who are working hard to join it. eos"
"sos everyone knows that the prime minister is raising taxes so he can keep spending on his personal priorities and the priorities of his wealthy friends: hundreds of millions of dollars for his friends at bombardier; half a billion dollars for his rich friends who run a bank in asia; and $10 million for a convicted terrorist who murdered an allied solider. eos sos canadians do not want to pay his bills, so will the pm finally end his attack on small business owners? eos","sos mr. speaker, only the conservatives could see lowering taxes on small businesses as an attack on small businesses. eos sos that is how partisan they have become. eos"
"sos he has tried to raise taxes on our brave women and men in the armed forces, and he has even had to apologize for raising taxes on canadians living with diabetes. eos sos why does the prime minister not just come clean and admit that all of these tax hikes are the consequences of his out of control spending and massive deficits? eos","sos mr. speaker, our approach has focused on growing the middle class and making sure that canadians have a real and fair opportunity to succeed, and across the country we are seeing the benefits of that happening. eos sos this year we created 441,000 new jobs, which is the top number for job creation in 18 years in this country. eos"
"sos indeed, recently, the prime minister insulted japan and australia when he skipped a meeting that would have allowed canada to sign onto the world's largest trading block. eos sos could the prime minister tell us what he is doing to repair the damage caused by his erratic behaviour? eos","sos mr. speaker, what stephen harper did not understand, what those conservatives over there continue not to understand, is that it is not just about signing any deal; it is about signing a good deal for canadians. eos sos we saw time and time again that they are just in a rush to try to sign anything to get along, but we know that no deal is better than a bad deal. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, it is not only australia and japan who are upset with the prime minister for his bizarre actions in asia. eos sos can the prime minister assure us that with his recent behaviour in china, his begging for a free trade agreement at all costs, he has not compromised our position at the nafta negotiating table and the millions of jobs today that depend on free trade between canada, the united states, and mexico? eos","sos mr. speaker, once again, the conservatives demonstrate that they still do not understand anything about getting a good trade deal for canadians. eos sos wherever we go around the world, we will be demanding a good deal for canada. eos"
"sos instead of a merit-based process, all we have are the liberals' assurances that they are doing the right thing, but that is not enough. eos sos how can they tell us that their nomination was merit-based, and if they want to pursue that line, why do they not release the names of the finalists to the other parties? eos","sos mr. speaker, on the issue of the lobbying commissioner and the official languages commissioner, we actually consulted opposition parties last june to see what criteria they were looking for, what their perspective was, and what stakeholders we should be consulting with. eos sos we have engaged them in a robust process that will determine, and end up with, the right kinds of officers of parliament. eos"
"sos because the selection committee for the new conflict of interest and ethics commissioner had five members, including the chief of staff of the leader of the government in the house of commons, the chief of staff of the president of the treasury board, and two assistant secretaries of the liberal cabinet. eos sos how can we have any faith that the selection process for the future commissioner was open, transparent, merit-based, and especially impartial, when the selection committee was dominated by liberal cabinet employees? eos","sos mr. speaker, i have to say that i completely disagree with my hon. eos sos colleague across the way. eos"
"sos i thought we usually hired an investigator to get to the bottom of a crime, not to cover the offender's tracks. eos sos is wiping the slate clean and starting fresh the liberals' new way of dealing with crises? eos","sos mr. speaker, i understand that everything is always about partisanship for the members of the opposition. eos sos however, we expect any conflict of interest and ethics commissioner and any officer of parliament to fulfill their duties with care and integrity. eos"
sos the only word to describe this is incompetence. eos sos when is the prime minister going to stop making life easier for his rich friends and harder for everyone else? eos,"sos mr. speaker, once again, conservatives are demonstrating that they do not understand how to help canadians. eos sos the statistics he is referring to do not take into account the canada child benefit. eos"
sos the prime minister cannot even read a balance sheet. eos sos how can canadians have any confidence in anything else he is doing? eos,"sos mr. speaker, in order to chase their goal of balancing the budget at all costs, they created the phoenix fiasco, they nickel and dimed our veterans, and they continued to cut services for canadians across the board. eos sos we made a different decision than they did. eos"
"sos giving the standing committee on access to information, privacy and ethics one hour with the candidate for the position of conflict of interest and ethics commissioner does not show openness; it limits the discussion. eos sos if the liberals really wanted to consult the opposition, why did they wait until the very last minute to do so? eos","sos mr. speaker, on the contrary, six months ago, early this summer, we consulted the opposition members. eos sos we asked them exactly what kind of concerns they had, whom we should talk to, and which communities should be involved in choosing who the next officers of parliament should be. eos"
"sos these watchdogs do not work for liberals; they work for all of parliament, and we represent all canadians. eos sos therefore, when will the prime minister drop his tired talking points, keep the promise to be open and accountable, and commit right now to follow the right process, the legal process, for these appointments? eos","sos mr. speaker, i thank the member opposite for his comments and for contributing to the supreme court appointment process. eos sos as he mentioned, it is a very good one. eos"
"sos they are trying to raise taxes on our family farmers and local businesses, and we continue to stop them. eos sos will the prime minister admit that he is just putting these tax increases targeted at vulnerable people on hold and that he will try to bring them back in, if, god forbid, he gets another chance after the next election? eos","sos mr. speaker, we lowered taxes on the middle class and raised them on the wealthiest 1%, and the conservatives tried to stop us. eos sos we brought in a canada child benefit that would give more money to nine out of 10 canadian families and lifts hundreds of thousands of kids out of poverty, and they tried to stop us. eos"
"sos their wealthiest friends continue to stash away their money in tax havens that the government has done nothing to address. eos sos when will the liberals admit that it is a government by the rich, of the rich, and for the rich? eos","sos mr. speaker, once again, in their pursuit of endless partisanship, the conservatives follow think tanks that do not include the whole picture. eos sos the stats they are quoting now do not actually include the canada child benefit. eos"
"sos no new taxes for his trust fund, no new taxes for morneau shepell, no new taxes for his fundraising chair, just more taxes for the working people who pay the bills in our country. eos sos why? eos","sos mr. speaker, one cannot help but feel bad for the conservatives. eos sos they are resorting to flailing around with personal attacks because we have created over 441,000 new jobs over these past 12 months. eos"
"sos the reality is that when the government gets bigger, the working class pays more. eos sos when are the liberals going to put an end to that injustice? eos","sos mr. speaker, once again, the first thing we did was lower taxes for the middle class and raise them on the wealthiest 1%. eos sos this summer, when we said we were going to be lowering taxes for small businesses and making sure that wealthy canadians would no longer be encouraged to use canadian-controlled private corporations to pay lower tax rates than middle-class canadians, those conservatives went on the warpath, scared everyone across the country, and are now sheepish that we are lowering taxes on small businesses as of january 1. they can do nothing but give personal attacks. eos"
"sos these investigations are important to canadians and certainly to our democracy, but the liberals do not seem to realize that. eos sos do the liberals think the commissioner should continue the investigations his predecessor started? eos","sos mr. speaker, canadians and especially parliamentarians expect officers of parliament to perform their duties with integrity and to make decisions based on facts. eos sos that is exactly what the commissioner said he would do. eos"
"sos these investigations are important for our democracy, and the liberals must be held to account. eos sos do the liberals not agree that investigations already started need to continue under the new commissioner or do they believe they are above the law? eos","sos mr. speaker, i think the question is whether parliamentarians and canadians expect officers of parliament to fulfill their duties with integrity, with responsibility, and based on the facts. eos sos that is exactly what the commissioner testified to yesterday. eos"
"sos as a result, a number of agreements were reached, including a coordinated approach on the cannabis excise framework. eos sos could the prime minister inform the house on the cannabis agreement, and how it benefits provinces, territories, and municipalities? eos","sos mr. speaker, cities and towns across the country are among our most important partners in our effort to legalize and strictly regulate access to cannabis. eos sos that is why we are providing the provinces and territories 75% of collected excise tax from cannabis, so municipalities can get the resources they need to keep cannabis away from kids and profits out of the hands of criminals. eos"
"sos however, for a divorced woman, it is assumed she will receive that dividend from the same company. eos sos therefore, from one feminist to another, how is that fair? eos","sos mr. speaker, on january 1, we are lowering small business taxes for 100% of small businesses across the country. eos sos three per cent of small businesses of canada-controlled private corporations use income sprinkling. eos"
sos this does not help anyone in this country. eos sos will the liberals withdraw these tax changes? eos,"sos mr. speaker, on january 1, small businesses will be paying lower taxes, because we are dropping the small business tax rate. eos sos for those canadian-controlled private corporations that do use income sprinkling, they will have the entirety of 2018 to determine how to give out dividends, and then they will have a few more months after that to prepare their taxes. eos"
"sos let us look at the minister of finance's record: he imposed a tax reform to raise taxes on small businesses; he was fined by the ethics commissioner because he failed to declare one of his companies that owned one of his villas in france; he failed to put his assets in a blind trust; he sold $10million worth of shares in his company days before introducing tax measures that he himself put in place; and he introduced billc-27, which earned his family's company more than $5million. eos sos when will the prime minister call for his minister of finance to resign? eos","sos mr. speaker, i can understand why the members across the way keep making these personal attacks. eos sos it is because the real record of our minister of finance is extremely positive: 441,000 new jobs created in the past 12 months, breaking an 18-year record. eos"
"sos this is the reality: a deficit of more than $20billion at the expense of our children and grandchildren, higher taxes for businesses, higher taxes for families, and no plan to balance the budget. eos sos my wish for canadians in 2018 is that the prime minister do the right thing: fire the finance minister and find one with integrity who will be transparent and do his job in a responsible manner. eos","sos the personal attacks keep coming, mr. speaker. eos sos the reality is that the minister of finance has met expectations, especially those of canadian families, with respect to canada's economy. eos"
"sos we need a diversity of voices, and leaving women out means they only get half the wisdom. eos sos how can this so-called feminist prime minister call this reconciliation, when he keeps blocking indigenous women's voices? eos","sos mr. speaker, that is simply not true. eos sos we continually work with indigenous women's organizations and indigenous groups across this country to ensure that all voicesyouth, elders, women, and survivors of residential schoolsare heard in every possible forum. eos"
"sos when will the government commit to real partnership with survivors? eos sos if i was asked, i would say that this does not seem like a real partnership. eos","sos mr. speaker, we must never allow this dark and painful chapter of our history to be forgotten. eos sos we are encouraging all survivors to share their stories and documents with the national centre for truth and reconciliation. eos"

sos what is worse is that the minister ordered his staff to publicly humiliate ms. davis. eos sos does the prime minister endorse his minister's actions? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the minister of sport and persons with disabilities has addressed these allegations. eos sos he is working on important legislation to increase accessibility in order to help every disabled canadian. eos"
"sos for his own political damage control, it seems he told his staff to publicly humiliate and discredit the wife of a sick veteran by sending screen shots of her personal facebook posts to the media. eos sos how can the prime minister condone his minister's words and actions? eos","sos mr. speaker, the minister has responded to these allegations. eos sos he continues to work on important measures that are going to make canada more accessible and ease the challenges facing canadians living with disabilities. eos"
sos my question for the prime minister is this. eos sos exactly how many ethical violations and investigations is it going to take before the liberals realize that the rules apply to them too? eos,"sos mr. speaker, as we come to the end of this year, one cannot help but feel bad for the members of the opposition, because of the results we have gotten as a government. eos sos the job creation numbers, 441,000 new jobs, the best in 18 years; the growing economy; the help for the middle class; and the positive outcomes leave the opposition with nothing to do but to fling accusations and throw mud. eos"
"sos raising awareness of fgm is a core part of the fight against it, and that is why it is listed in canada's citizenship guide as a practice canada does not tolerate. eos sos i have a simple question: will the prime minister end his consultations on fgm and decide today that warnings about fgm belong in canada's citizenship guide? eos","sos mr. speaker, being vocal about this important issue is something i have always done. eos sos indeed, when i was last in west africa, i actually spoke up clearly and strongly against this issue. eos"
"sos it is also facing a $10-million class action lawsuit. eos sos how does this government plan to impose strict environmental regulations, and why is there no late penalty, given that the dismantling is already six years overdue? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government is committed to protecting the health and safety of canadians and of our waters. eos sos we are taking the necessary steps to ensure that the permanent removal of the kathryn spirit is carried out safely and efficiently. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, during her testimony to the house of commons standing committee on industry, science and technology, the minister of science told the committee that when she was at the g7 in italy, canada was viewed as a beacon for science around the world. eos sos could the prime minister update the house on the actions he is taking to ensure that canada remains a top destination for international talent and how that is benefiting post-secondary institutions in canada, but especially in my home province of british columbia? eos","sos mr. speaker, i thank the member for his advocacy on behalf of his constituents and his province. eos sos our government's support for research and innovation is being noticed around the world. eos"
sos when will the prime minister make national security a top priority and ask the davie shipyard to build the obelix? eos sos will he do so before the holidays? eos,"sos mr. speaker, it is important to remember that the procurement requirements of the navy and the coast guard were subject to a comprehensive review. eos sos for the moment, the long-term procurement plan does not include a second supply ship. eos"
"sos this is the last chance to announce a real contract in the house so that workers can keep their jobs. eos sos will the prime minister take that chance, show some compassion, and protect jobs at the davie shipyard? eos","sos mr. speaker, we are still very concerned about the impact of job losses on workers and their families, and we acknowledge the excellent work done by davie employees. eos sos with regard to other shipbuilding projects, the strategy allocates $2 billion for competitive projects granted to canadian shipyards like davie. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, i seek the consent of the house to move the following motion: that the house condemn the horrific acts committed by isis; acknowledge that individuals who joined isis fighters are complicit in these horrific acts and pose a danger to all canadians; call on the government to bring to justice and prosecute any isis fighter returning to canada; and insist that the government make the security and protection of canadians its priority, rather than the reintegration of isis fighters. eos",sos does the hon. eos sos member have the unanimous consent of the house to move the motion? eos
"sos mr. speaker, moments ago, during question period, in his response to a question from the member for carleton, the prime minister mentioned a study that he said came from a lobby group, but the study is actually from the finance department, and for the eighth time, i seek the consent of the house to table the document. eos sos [english] it is from the department of finance annual financial report of the government of canada, 2016-17, page 16, personal income tax revenues decreased by $1.2 billion, or 0.8%, in 201617, largely reflecting the impact of tax planning by high-income individuals.  eos",sos does the hon. eos sos member have the unanimous consent of the house to table the document? eos

"sos canadians are generous, and compassion is one of our core values. eos sos can the prime minister give the house an update on the amount collected? eos","sos mr. speaker, i thank the member for bromemissisquoi for his question. eos sos our government is still very concerned about the situation of the rohingya in myanmar and bangladesh. eos"

"sos the conflict of interest act states that the prime minister is responsible for arrang[ing] his or her private affairs in a manner that will prevent [him] from being in a conflict of interest. eos sos therefore, does the prime minister agree with the ethics commissioner that he failed to meet these standards as required by law? eos","sos mr. speaker, immediately after the report was released i took responsibility. eos sos i accepted the full recommendations of the commissioner and will be moving forward in a such a way that any personal vacations or family travel gets approved in advance by the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner. eos"
"sos the prime minister should have been aware of his responsibilities under the conflict of interest act, especially when it comes to mixing government business and friendship. eos sos why did he do nothing to ensure that he was not in a conflict of interest? eos","sos mr. speaker, as the commissioner concluded, i did not take part in any decisions regarding the aga khan or the aga khan foundation. eos"
"sos this is despite the aga khan's frequent dealings with the previous government and ongoing projects, all of which the prime minister was briefed on. eos sos does the prime minister really expect us to believe that it was impossible to anticipate any conflict of interest? eos","sos mr. speaker, when the commissioner put out her report, we accepted it immediately, and i took responsibility for my actions. eos sos at the same time, moving forward, as is important and as canadians expect, we will ensure that we work with the conflict of interest commissioner on any personal family vacation or any personal travel the prime minister undertakes in the future. eos"
"sos now, that meeting request, which was accepted, was made just two days before the prime minister took one of his vacations to the aga khan's private island. eos sos accepting a meeting with lobbyists representing the man whose generous hospitality he was about to enjoy, how could the prime minister not realize that was a conflict of interest? eos","sos mr. speaker, as i have said, i accept the full recommendations and conclusions of the commissioner. eos sos i think it is important that the commissioner and that we recognize a more stringent set of rules for what constitutes a friendship. eos"
"sos he allows ceos to keep their lucrative stock option loophole, while telling sears workers to suck it up and be happy with ei rather than their own pensions that they paid into. eos sos when will he get to work for these people rather than his ceo friends? eos","sos mr. speaker, as the member opposite knows, especially because the member opposite voted against it, the very first thing we did was lower taxes for the middle class and raise them on the wealthiest 1%. eos sos we then delivered a canada child benefit that gives more money to nine out of 10 canadian families by not sending child benefit cheques to millionaire families. eos"
sos the prime minister lets ceos keep their generous tax deductions for stock options while asking sears employees to settle for employment insurance instead of the pensions they poured their own money into. eos sos when will he finally fight for all canadians instead of just the 1%? eos,"sos mr. speaker, on the contrary, the first thing this government did was lower taxes for the middle class and increase them for the wealthy. eos sos next, we created the canada child benefit, which gives more tax-free money every month to nine out of 10 families. eos"
"sos there is something simple this government can do: support measures in my bill that help workers like those at sears canada and prevent them from ever again being faced with losing their pension benefits. eos sos instead of monitoring the situation, when will the government break from tradition and get to work to protect our workers? eos","sos mr. speaker, i want to thank the member for his hard work and advocacy on this issue, and i understand the challenges that many workers, families, and communities face across this country. eos sos my heart goes out to all those who are affected. eos"
"sos he has told the investors about the opportunities of going after defined plans, and he has brought in the legislation, bill c-27, to make it possible. eos sos at the very least, will the finance minister withdraw bill c-27 and recuse himself from any discussions about the sears workers? eos","sos mr. speaker, the member opposite should know full well that when it comes to the sears employees, we have been engaging with them and working with them, because we know the challenges they are going through. eos sos we know the impact this has on many different communities. eos"

sos the prime minister broke the law by accepting these trips. eos sos will he do the right thing and pay taxpayers back? eos,"sos mr. speaker, as has been said, the report was released and the prime minister accepted those recommendations. eos sos the commissioner also found that the prime minister did not participate in or make any decisions relating to the aga khan or his institutions as has sometimes been implied by the opposite side, which is unfortunate. eos"

"sos it is appalling. eos sos after so many appeals for help, why are seasonal workers still waiting? eos","sos mr. speaker, i am pleased to have the opportunity to indicate once again how crucial it is to recognize the importance of employment insurance in supporting our workers in precarious situations, as well as their communities and the employers that need their efforts to continue to develop their communities. eos sos this is especially true in seasonal employment situations, which, as we know, are so difficult in eastern quebec and the maritimes. eos"
"sos by forcing groups to sign the prime minister's values test, the government is denying help to groups that provide aid to refugees, run day camp programs for kids with disabilities, and help at-risk youth. eos sos on behalf of these organizations from across canada, will the liberals finally remove this values test from the canada summer jobs application? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government knows that funding should never go to pay for work that seeks to actively undermine canadians' rights. eos sos unlike the harper conservatives who had no problem funding groups like the centre for bio-ethical reform, who put kids to work distributing flyers featuring graphic images of aborted fetuses, we are committed to protecting canadians' rights. eos"

"sos it is a sad day when the minister tags along on the prime minister's illegal vacation, blowing $200,000 and later telling veterans who suffered injuries fighting for our country that they are asking too much. eos sos does the minister not agree with our veterans that the $200,000 the pm used for his illegal vacation would have been better spent on eos",sos the hon. eos sos minister of veterans affairs. eos

"sos however, the priority is to pay all public servants what they are owed on time. eos sos when will that happen? eos","sos mr. speaker, we are very concerned about the uncertainty being caused among public servants by the phoenix system and i can truly empathize with them. eos sos we are doing all we can in terms of governance and partnerships. eos"
"sos since then, we have celebrated international women's day on march 8. this date has become an international day to acknowledge the achievements of women and represents a call to action to advance gender equality. eos sos [english] will the minister of status of women tell the house how we can celebrate canada's progress toward achieving greater equality for women and people of all genders this coming international women's day? eos","sos mr. speaker, feminists like the hon. eos sos member for brossardsaint-lambert have shaped our country's history, from the early suffragettes to the activists, advocates, and leaders of today. eos"
"sos why, when the shipyard successfully completed its work by the deadline? eos sos when will the minister honour the prime minister's words and deliver the ships, the icebreakers, and the obelix? eos","sos mr. speaker, davie shipyard is an important shipyard. eos sos we recognize that it has experienced workers, who did excellent work in delivering the asterix. eos"
"sos ottawa, however, is doing the opposite and giving the web giants whatever they want. eos sos why? eos","sos mr. speaker, high-quality local and community information is essential to our democracy. eos sos we have reinvested in cbc/radio-canada, as my colleague is well aware. eos"
"sos we made great progress and great advancements in last year's budget in financing home care and palliative care, but there is more to do. eos sos will the minister of health tell us what has been done recently to help organizations that provide palliative care and in-home medical care? eos","sos mr. speaker, i would like to thank my friend and colleague the member for cumberland colchester for his hard work on this matter. eos sos as my colleague highlighted, in addition to canada's health transfer, our government is providing $6 billion to provinces and territories to support better home care and palliative care services. eos"
sos we have heard that a canadian is a canadian is a canadian. eos sos will the government denounce the killing of this canadian and repudiate its failing iran appeasement policy? eos,"sos mr. speaker, on behalf of the canadian government and the house of commons, i want to extend our sympathy to the family of mr. seyed-emami. eos sos we are deeply concerned about the circumstances surrounding his death. eos"
"sos while the situation was deteriorating in alberta and british columbia, the prime minister was busy travelling around the united states. eos sos will the prime minister finally show some leadership, do his job, and fix this problem once and for all? eos","sos mr. speaker, we have made it very clear that the trans mountain project is in the national interest. eos sos that is why we will make sure that it gets built. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, clearly, people who make fun of the prime minister's making up words that do not exist are not nazis. eos sos will the prime minister condemn and apologize for the comments of his principal secretary? eos","sos mr. speaker, we take very seriously the importance of creating open opportunities for dialogue. eos sos that is why i was so pleased to get out there and do town halls across the country, at which i took a broad range of questions from canadians in a very honest and open environment. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, quite obviously the most powerful staff member to the most powerful politician in canada should not be calling people nazis. eos sos will the prime minister condemn and apologize for the comments of his principal secretary? eos","sos mr. speaker, when it comes to civil discourse, when it comes to the kinds of back and forth that happen in the house, it is a real shame to see the conservatives using lines straight out of rebel media and the rebel webcast. eos sos the rebel should not be writing commentary and questions for the members opposite. eos"
sos thousands of sears retirees have lost their post-retirement benefits and are waiting to hear how much of their pensions they will lose. eos sos when will the government offer canadians some real hope that this kind of corporate theft will never happen again? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i would like to thank the member opposite for his advocacy. eos sos he knows full well that under the ccaa process, sears went under a restructuring and refinancing process that unfortunately did not work out well. eos"
sos my question is for the prime minister. eos sos what steps will he take to reassure the boushie family and indigenous youth across the country that justice will be made real for colten boushie? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our thoughts of course are with the family and friends of colten boushie. eos sos while it would be completely inappropriate to comment on the specifics of this case, we understand there are systemic issues in our criminal justice system that we must address. eos"
"sos the system has failed indigenous people all the way back to poundmaker, and it has to stop. eos sos therefore, in this watershed moment, what concrete steps will the prime minister take to deal with the huge legal inequities that are faced by indigenous people all across the country? eos","sos mr. speaker, we agree. eos sos when indigenous adults make up 3% of our population but 26% of our incarcerated population, there is a problem. eos"
sos i applaud the minister's recent announcement to build an inland rescue boat station in my hometown of rankin inlet. eos sos will the minister consider taking further steps to increase and strengthen departmental presence in nunavut? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government recognizes the importance of the arctic in terms of the opportunities it offers for commercial fishing. eos sos budget 2017 included funding to expand indigenous commercial fishing programs to canada's north. eos"
"sos in far too many instances, like the trial that followed the tragic death of colten boushie in my home province, that is not the case. eos sos what is the government doing to address the under-representation of indigenous peoples on canadian juries? eos","sos mr. speaker, i would echo my hon. eos sos colleague's sentiments to the boushie family in their time of grief, and recognize that we, as a country, have to do more in terms of the criminal justice system and the overrepresentation of indigenous peoples, black canadians, and other marginalized individuals within the system. eos"
"sos the use of peremptory challenges means lawyers can reject jurors for no reason at all: maybe they do not like the way they look, or maybe it is the colour of their skin. eos sos as a first step to ensure real community representation, especially following the tragic death of colten boushie, will the minister review and possibly revoke the use of peremptory challenges under the criminal code? eos","sos mr. speaker, first, we are undertaking a broad-based review of the criminal justice system. eos sos i look forward to bringing forward reform, in the near future. eos"
sos the lack of federal leadership has left alberta on its own and now everyone will have to pay the price. eos sos when will the prime minister act like a prime minister and do his job? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i do not know why the hon. eos sos member will not take yes for an answer. eos"
sos how can we trust a process based on the minister's whims? eos sos will the minister now agree to remove her veto power from the bill? eos,"sos mr. speaker, it is extraordinarily rich to hear the party opposite talk about science. eos sos the conservatives never ever took into account science or indigenous knowledge. eos"
"sos now they are creating an environmental review process that is filled with more uncertainty than ever before, discouraging investment in canada. eos sos when will the minister finally stop her partisan attacks and rebuild investor confidence in canada's resource sector? eos","sos mr. speaker, i certainly encourage the party opposite to stop the partisan attacks. eos sos we understand that the environment and the economy go together. eos"
sos can the minister tell us which projects approved under the former process she does not agree with? eos sos which projects would she like to see fail? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our party makes decisions based on science, and the party opposite makes decisions based on science fiction. eos sos for projects to move forward, we must make decisions based on science, we must listen to canadians, and we must work with indigenous peoples. eos"
"sos our producers put their heart and soul into producing quality food for canadians, however, it is these folks who will be directly impacted by these ill-advised decisions. eos sos in the spirit of this important day, will the liberals reverse this ideological decision and listen to the agriculture sector and health experts to ensure we have a balanced approach to the canadian food guide? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government is committed to protecting the health of canadians and supporting an environment that makes the healthy choice the easy choice. eos sos for the past 70 years, canada's food guide has been one of the most trusted sources of information for canadians. eos"
"sos obviously, the world would be a safer place without nuclear weapons, and canada should participate in the diplomatic efforts being made to achieve that goal. eos sos will the prime minister commit to ensuring that canada signs the nuclear weapons ban treaty, which is supported by 120countries? eos","sos mr. speaker, canada strongly supports worldwide nuclear disarmament and continues to support efforts in that area. eos sos we recently announced an additional investment of $1.5million to support the international atomic energy agency in its important work. eos"
"sos since a core tenet of nato is to create the conditions for a world free of nuclear weapons, there is clearly no obstacle to canada signing the nuclear prohibition treaty. eos sos therefore, will the prime minister now take bold action, sign the nuclear prohibition treaty, and then instruct our nato ambassador to start working to get all of our nato allies behind this treaty so canada can help the world move back from the brink of nuclear disaster? eos","sos mr. speaker, canada unequivocally supports global nuclear disarmament. eos sos we continue to support efforts that substantially contribute to this goal. eos"
sos we are concerned about the impact that the lack of consultation and the refusal to consult with canada's agriculture and agrifood partners will have on canadians' health. eos sos will the government reconsider its narrow-minded and ill-advised approach and finally hold broader consultations on the food guide with all agriculture and agrifood stakeholders for the good of all canadians? eos,"sos mr. speaker, yesterday, i had the pleasure of meeting with stakeholders from the dairy industry. eos sos our government is committed to protecting the health of canadians and to supporting a health framework based on healthy choices. eos"
sos why have the liberals chosen to downplay the vital role of meat and dairy products in the diets of canadians? eos sos why this attack on science? eos,"sos mr. speaker, yesterday i had the privilege of meeting with the dairy industry of canada and had a very productive meeting. eos sos [translation]
              our government is committed to safeguarding canadians' health and supporting a health framework that makes the healthy choice the easier choice. eos"
sos i will repeat. eos sos what is the government's specific plan to ensure that indigenous peoples are treated fairly by our justice system? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we have been working diligently since we came into government, building on the work that has occurred over decades advocated by indigenous peoples and the like to ultimately improve our criminal justice system. eos sos we will propose broad-based reform to the criminal justice system and we have, as i stated yesterday, committed to looking at the under-representation of indigenous peoples on juries. eos"
"sos canadian agriculture is stronger, more innovative, and more diverse than ever and our government is committed to continuing this growth and investing in the future of canadian farmers. eos sos could the minister of agriculture and agri-food tell us about today's announcement to build a strong future for canadian agriculture? eos","sos mr. speaker, i want to thank the hon. eos sos member for miramichigrand lake for his hard work for our farmers and ranchers throughout this country. eos"
sos the liberals' changes also reflect their lack of understanding of the importance of resource development to canada's economy. eos sos why are the liberals opposing responsible resource development and delaying vital infrastructure projects in rural communities across canada? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we are very proud of the changes we have made to the canadian navigable waters act, an act that had been gutted by the previous government, an act in which canadians no longer had confidence. eos sos we have restored the protection in the navigable waters act, and canadians can be very proud of the fact that we are looking after their interests with respect to navigation. eos"
"sos the results showed that responding to humanitarian crises and natural disasters, promoting access to healthcare for women, children, and youth, and promoting gender equality are key policies that canada should pursue. eos sos can the minister of international development tell the house how canada plans to make this vision a reality? eos","sos mr. speaker, i want to thank my colleague from bourassa for his question and for his interest in international development and our youth. eos sos our government wants to offer young canadians a personally and professionally rewarding international experience. eos"
sos canadians are feeling more confident about their future. eos sos could the minister of finance please update the house on the next steps that we are taking to strengthen canada's middle class and help those working hard to join it? eos,"sos mr. speaker, over the last couple of years the plan we have put in place for canadians has made real improvements for middle-class canadians. eos sos some hon. eos"
sos the hon. eos sos minister of finance has the floor. eos,"sos mr. speaker, we have seen real improvements over the last couple of years for middle-class canadians, more confidence, and among the lowest unemployment rates in the last four years. eos sos however, there is more work to do. eos"
"sos the minister of finance treated farmers like tax cheats, the minister of agriculture and agri-food is not taking part in international negotiations, and the minister of health does not want to hear what farmers have to say about the new food guide. eos sos will the liberal government finally do the right thing and listen to what farmers have to say about their future? eos","sos mr. speaker, i assure my hon. eos sos colleague that we have been listening to farmers and that we are responding to farmers. eos"
"sos with pulse exports to india worth over $1.5 billion, it is critical for canada to work on a clear agreement. eos sos will the prime minister include the agriculture minister on this important trade mission? eos","sos mr. speaker, we are extremely concerned and disappointed with india's increase in import duties, without any advance notice to canada or any other nation. eos sos we are raising our concerns with the government of india, including on a recent trade mission by the minister of international trade, who brought it up on every occasion. eos"
sos the liberals have no plan. eos sos how is the minister of agriculture and agri-food going to ensure that no new concessions will be made to the americans under nafta? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we have been clear. eos sos we continue to defend supply management. eos"
"sos however, there is very real concern that canada could miss out on these vital new markets if we are not one of the first members to ratify the agreement. eos sos on canada's agriculture day, can the liberals assure our agriculture and agrifood exporters that they will sign the tpp later next month and will ratify it next summer? eos","sos mr. speaker, as the member has said, this is a good agreement on agriculture day. eos sos we should all celebrate in the house that this is going to be good for our country. eos"
sos we are learning today of significant investments being made in quebec cannabis companies by offshore accounts that have anonymous members. eos sos can the prime minister give us assurances that these are not companies set up by organized crime? eos,"sos mr. speaker, right now the sale of marijuana across this country puts billions of dollars in the pockets of organized crime. eos sos that is a failure of the current, actual system. eos"
sos the founder of that company is the former chief financial officer of the liberal party of canada. eos sos canadians deserve to have the assurance that there is no organized crime element within these secret investors. eos,"sos mr. speaker, one of the fundamental reasons for legalizing and controlling the sale of marijuana is to reduce the amount of profit going into the coffers of organized crime across the country. eos sos for 10 years, the conservative government allowed to perpetuate a system of prohibition that actually created sources of funding for organized crime, street gangs, and gun runners to continue to expand their illicit activities. eos"
"sos wherever there is money and tax havens, there are liberal party cronies ready to do anything to line their pockets. eos sos is this why the prime minister is being stubborn and interfering with the work of the senators in the senate? eos","sos mr. speaker, it is very simple, the current system is failing. eos sos it fails to protect our children, it fails to protect our communities, and it fails to keep organized crime from making billions of dollars per year in profits from marijuana sales. eos"
sos anonymous investors from tax havens have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in canadian companies owned by liberal cronies. eos sos can the prime minister assure canadians that no one involved in organized crime and none of his liberal friends are involved with these marijuana producers? eos,"sos mr. speaker, part of our framework for the sale of marijuana and associated investments involves extensive screenings and background checks of everyone who works in the marijuana industry, including investors. eos sos yes, we will ensure that no one involved in organized crime invests in the sale and production of marijuana. eos"
"sos they are all affluent liberals, people the prime minister knows personally, and they are all going to get richer with the legalization of cannabis. eos sos is this another sponsorship scandal? eos","sos mr. speaker, again, the conservatives are trying to divert attention from their own failure on this file. eos sos the conservative government perpetuated a system that made it easier for young people to access marijuana in canada than in 29 other countries in the world. eos"
"sos what is clear to me and what is clear to canadians is that highly connected liberal insiders are not shy about exploiting canada's weakness on tax havens to invest in cannabis production. eos sos why is the prime minister so slow in acting on the unaccountability of the cra, so slow in acting against tax havens, and even slower in addressing the critical issue of anonymous tax haven investors in cannabis production? eos","sos mr. speaker, it is nice to see the ndp and conservatives working together for once. eos sos the minister of finance recently reached an agreement with his provincial and territorial counterparts to ensure that we know who owns which corporations, which will prevent canadian or international companies from facilitating tax evasion, money laundering, and other criminal activities. eos"
sos this is a wake-up call the prime minister is ignoring. eos sos when will he wake up and realize that the involvement of these liberal friends is just the tip of the iceberg? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we are going to continue to crack down on tax evasion and tax avoidance by making investments. eos sos we invested nearly $1billion in the canada revenue agency for that very purpose. eos"
sos what are the prime minister's real intentions in legalizing cannabis? eos sos is it simply so that friends of the liberal party of canada can make more money? eos,"sos mr. speaker, with regard to tax information, we are focused on transparency and increasing and expanding the sharing of information. eos sos canada has a vast network of treaties and a number of tools that enabled the canada revenue agency to share 2.2million pieces of information last year. eos"
sos perfect for money laundering. eos sos why is the prime minister being so utterly irresponsible? eos,"sos mr. speaker, protecting the health and safety of canadians is a top priority for our government, and that is why we are moving forward on a legalized regime for the sale of marijuana. eos sos under our proposed regulations, security clearances will be mandatory for individuals who occupy key positions in any organization, as well as background checks on significant investors to any marijuana company. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, on the subject of ministers receiving valuable and improper gifts, the liberal vice-chair of the ethics committee, a liberal member of the prime minister's caucus said, i do think repayment of the reasonable value of an improper gift that one receives is prudent and reasonable under the act. eos sos does the prime minister agree with the liberal vice-chair of the ethics committee that ministers should return the commercial value of any improper gift they receive? eos","sos mr. speaker, immediately after the ethics commissioner released her report, i accepted the findings of the report, took responsibility, and am following up on every single element of her advice or recommendations. eos sos that is what canadians expect, and that following of the ethic commissioner's advice and recommendations is exactly what canadians expect of any of us. eos"
"sos i think members know that canadians, the public, have the capacity to do that. eos sos they do not need assistance from this chamber. eos","sos mr. speaker, i am glad the prime minister mentioned the ethics commissioner, because his vice-chair asked the ethics commissioner if he agreed that a minister should return any improperly received gifts. eos sos the commissioner said, of course it would be . eos"
sos i accept the full recommendations and advice of the ethics commissioner. eos sos they do not have anything else to criticize us on. eos,"sos mr. speaker, we are just trying to help liberal cabinet ministers understand what the rules are. eos sos that is why i am asking the prime minister. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, as has been the case for previous prime ministers, and as the former commissioner herself stated, security costs are incurred whenever and wherever the prime minister travels. eos sos moving forward, of course, i am happy to follow all the advice and recommendations that the commissioner had made, including those surrounding personal and private travel. eos","sos mr. speaker, i am not talking about the cost of the transportation and security. eos sos i am talking about the commercial value of a gift. eos"
"sos i am actually pleased that the ethics commissioner made clarifications, significantly put forward recommendations. eos sos i accepted responsibility and have endeavoured and will commit to following all the recommendations of the ethics commissioner. eos","sos mr. speaker, paragraph 121(1)(c) of the criminal code says it is an offence for a government official to accept from a person who has dealings with the government a commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind for themselves or another person. eos sos if the prime minister learned that one of his ministers had accepted a benefit from someone who had dealings with the government, what would he do about it? eos"
"sos i have fully accepted all the findings, all the advice, and all the recommendations by the ethics commissioner. eos sos i thanked her for her work and will keep going eos",sos the hon. eos sos member for carleton. eos
"sos this is a prime minister who accepted a gift that is worth approximately $200,000 from someone who was seeking a $15 million grant from the government of canada. eos sos does he dispute these facts? eos","sos mr. speaker, the issue we have run into before with this particular member opposite is that he was able to say things in the house of commons under parliamentary immunity that he would no longer repeat outside. eos sos the fact is that we have an ethics commissioner whose job it is to look at the facts to determine what is public, what is private, what is responsible and what is not, what are personal attacks and what are not. eos"
"sos this sector has shed 16,000 jobs and now our media, journalists, and democracy need urgent measures. eos sos will the prime minister commit to include urgent measures in his next budget? eos","sos mr. speaker, high-quality local and community information is essential to our democracy. eos sos as a result of our $675-million investment in cbc/radio-canada, new journalists are now in communities where previously there had been no coverage. eos"
"sos months have passed and job losses are a daily occurrence in the media. eos sos how many consultations, reports, and recommendations will it take for the government to decide to do something, even to act on a single recommendation? eos","sos mr. speaker, reliable local and community news is essential for the functioning of our democracy. eos sos for example, we have invested $675 million in cbc-radio canada that then turned around and introduced journalists into areas where they had never served before. eos"
sos women have been waiting for far too long. eos sos when will the government keep its promise and stop this injustice? eos,"sos mr. speaker, a gender pay gap in 2018 is unacceptable. eos sos after 10 years of inaction by the previous government, we are working to eliminate the pay gap and support womens participation in the workforce. eos"
"sos whether it is climate change, economic prosperity, or social justice issues, young canadians are ready to have their voices added to the conversation. eos sos will the prime minister please update the house and all canadians on the launch of a national dialogue on canada's first youth policy and how young canadians can get involved? eos","sos mr. speaker, as we know, young canadians are not just leaders of tomorrow; they are leaders today. eos sos we announced the launch of a new interactive online platform, youthaction.ca, where young canadians can share their ideas and perspectives on the development of a youth policy. eos"
sos when will this government keep its promises and help seasonal workers? eos sos maybe in the upcoming budget? eos,"sos mr. speaker, when we were elected, we promised to restore employment insurance and reverse the conservatives' changes, and that is exactly what we did. eos sos i would like to thank all our members from the atlantic provinces, quebec, and elsewhere in the country who worked with us to give seasonal workers the employment insurance options they need. eos"
"sos today, oxfam's regional director for asia said she knew of claims of sexual abuse involving their staff in the philippines. eos sos will the prime minister suspend funding to oxfam? eos","sos mr. speaker, we strongly condemn all forms of exploitation and abuse of women and children in the conduct of international aid operations and we take these situations and these allegations very seriously. eos sos oxfam canada and oxfam-qubec confirm that no employee or canadian funds are connected to the deplorable situation in haiti. eos"
sos the conservatives kept newcomer families apart by making them wait for over 26 months to be reunited in canada with their spouses and children. eos sos will the prime minister please give the house an update on how our government is continuing to support family reunification on this valentine's day? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i want to first thank the member for surrey centre for his advocacy on this family reunification issue. eos sos the conservatives left us a backlog of over 75,000 applications and forced families to remain separated from each other for over two years. eos"
"sos this is not how to treat victims of crime, so no one should say that race was not a huge part of this tragedy. eos sos will the prime minister agree to an independent investigation into the rcmp's handling of the boushie killing, and tell the house that the rcmp in saskatchewan will finally be brought under an independent review process to deal with police complaints? eos","sos mr. speaker, i was touched and honoured to be able to sit with colten boushie's family members just yesterday, and to reflect with them on the challenges facing not just them, but indigenous peoples across the country, facing the justice system and facing police services. eos sos what i was incredibly inspired by in their conversation was that despite all the pain and anger, they are very much focused on fixing the system for the future for other families. eos"
sos we know that supporting seasonal workers is essential. eos sos could the prime minister tell us more about this situation to address the concerns of seasonal workers? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i want to thank the member from avignonla mitismatanematapdia for his question. eos sos i would like to start by saying that all of our atlantic and quebec mps are doing a great job of representing their constituents and drawing attention to the ei gap, which is a major problem. eos"
"sos the davie shipyard workers are being shortchanged despite having successfully delivered the first supply ship, the asterix, on time and on budget. eos sos when will the shipyard workers get to resume working on the four icebreakers the prime minister promised? eos","sos mr. speaker, the davie shipyard is a major shipyard and we recognize the expertise of its workers. eos sos they did an excellent job delivering the asterix. eos"
"sos instead of accepting the decisions made by the house and the senate, he came back with his own bill, which favours the offenders over the women. eos sos why will he not acknowledge that his bill is sloppy, and when will he help and protect these vulnerable women? eos","sos mr. speaker, our approach as a feminist government has been to invest in women, support women, invest in combatting gender-based violence, and ensure that women have recourse in difficult situations. eos sos we will continue to support women. eos"
"sos gatineau park is a cherished resource within our national capital region, and home to 118 rare or endangered species, but despite its importance, there are no restrictions on development and no set borders for the park. eos sos will the prime minister and the minister of canadian heritage accept cpaws' request and amend the national capital act to protect the ecological integrity of gatineau park and establish its boundaries in law? eos","sos mr. speaker, like many people who live in ottawa, we appreciate gatineau park to an extraordinary degree. eos sos the trails and the millions of canadians who visit it every year make it a true jewel in our national capital region. eos"
"sos he has been silent even on the death of a canadian, professor seyed-emami, in an iranian prison on the weekend. eos sos instead of silence from the prime minister, when can we have him stand up for human rights, for democracy, and for canadians, instead of cozying up to the iranian regime? eos","sos mr. speaker, this government has been consistent in standing up for human rights everywhere around the world. eos sos whenever i meet with any leader around the world, i bring up human rights and we talk about the importance of protecting canadian interests. eos"
"sos the prime minister has said nothing thus far on the protest. eos sos could he stand up and finally support the cause of protesters who are fighting for democracy, human rights, justice, and the rule of law? eos","sos mr. speaker, on this side of the house we are always unequivocal about standing up for lgbtq rights. eos sos we are, of course, deeply troubled by the deaths and detentions of protesters during protests in iran. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, paragraph 121(1)(c) of the criminal code makes it an offence for a government official to accept from a person who has dealings with the government a commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind for themselves or another person. eos sos was the prime minister aware of this paragraph of the criminal code when he accepted a $200,000 gift from a person who has dealings with his government? eos","sos mr. speaker, again, above the mudslinging, we have a conflict of interest and ethics commissioner, who is tasked with looking into the facts of issues, making recommendations, and holding all parliamentarians to account. eos sos when the commissioner put forward her report, i fully accepted that report, took responsibility, and have been implementing the advice and recommendations she made. eos"
sos did the prime minister accept a benefit from the aga khan? eos sos does the aga khan have dealings with the government? eos,"sos mr. speaker, these are all questions that the ethics commissioner dug into in her report and made clear recommendations on. eos sos however, what is clear is that on this side of the house we value and respect the work done by officers of parliament. eos"
sos the rcmp is responsible for that. eos sos did the prime minister or his office ever discuss his island vacation with any member of the rcmp? eos,"sos mr. speaker, again, the ethics commissioner did a complete and thorough investigation, at the request of members opposite. eos sos i co-operated with the ethics commissioner every step of the way, and her report is fulsome and rigorous. eos"
"sos he broke four sections of the ethics law, and now he wants to turn himself into the victim because the opposition is asking legitimate questions about section 121 of the criminal code. eos sos does he dispute that he accepted thousands of dollars of benefits from somebody who had official dealings with his government and with him personally? eos","sos mr. speaker, in this place we have a system where different parties ask questions and hold governments to account, and it works very well. eos sos what also works very well is that canadians can be reassured that above the mudslinging and personal attacks, we have officers of parliament, like the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner, who will dig into the actual facts of the matter and make thorough investigations. eos"
"sos will the prime minister, who is the grand master of apologies, follow suit and apologize to honest taxpayers, the people who pay their taxes, while his government is giving a free pass to the wealthy by signing more agreements with tax havens? eos sos this deserves a real apology. eos","sos mr. speaker, the very first thing we did in government was lower taxes for the middle class and ask the wealthy to do a little more and pay more taxes. eos sos next, we introduced the canada child benefit, which is giving more money to nine out of ten families and will lift 40% of young people out of poverty. eos"
"sos with the budget coming in two weeks, will the government finally introduce measures to legislate equal pay for women? eos sos we are looking for action, not words. eos","sos mr. speaker, i am very pleased that half an hour into question period we finally get a question on the upcoming budget. eos sos we consider that a gender wage gap in 2018 is unacceptable. eos"
"sos our veterans have given so much, and the prime minister always seems to have something for everyone else. eos sos why will the prime minister not hear our veterans' legitimate concerns? eos","sos mr. speaker, not only have we heard the legitimate concerns of veterans, but we have also acted. eos sos canadians know that our government is committed to the well-being of veterans and their families. eos"
sos is it fairness that he thinks they do not deserve? eos sos what of those three things is too much to ask of the government? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we believe that those three things are exactly what our veterans deserve, and that is exactly what our government has delivered and will continue to deliver. eos sos it is a bit ironic to hear a member who served in the previous conservative government talking about respecting veterans. eos"
"sos now we know how that turned out. eos sos now that he is in office, why is the prime minister breaking yet another promise and turning his back on our veterans? eos","sos mr. speaker, as i said earlier, we are doing exactly the opposite of what my hon. eos sos colleague says we are doing. eos"
"sos it reads:
              
                
                  as minister of veterans affairs and associate minister of national defence, your overarching goal will be to ensure that our government lives up to our sacred obligation to veterans and their families. eos sos with regard to the disrespectful comments that the prime minister made to a veteran in edmonton, will he show a modicum of respect and apologize to all veterans across canada? eos","sos mr. speaker, our prime minister was very clear during the election campaign, as were my liberal caucus colleagues, and my colleague the minister of veterans affairs. eos sos everyone very clearly indicated that we respect the solemn obligation to our veterans. eos"
"sos take, for example, the temporary skating rink in front of parliament, the $1.1-million renovation of a minister's office, and billion-dollar deficits every year. eos sos here is the question everyone wants to ask: will the prime minister apologize? eos","sos mr. speaker, my colleague should try to be consistent. eos sos he cannot criticize us for running a deficit and at the same time ask us to invest more to help veterans. eos"
sos what happened to the prime minister who promised to do right by our veterans and give them the support they deserve? eos sos how can the prime minister and the government justify breaking this promise to our vets? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i think we were very clear in the election campaign, but more importantly, since we formed the government over two and a half years ago, that we respect the sacred obligation that canada has toward our veterans. eos sos not only did we commit to a pension for life, which is something that my colleague, the minister of veterans affairs, has delivered for the brave men and women who served in our canadian armed forces, but we also committed to reopening offices closed by the previous government. eos"
"sos now that he is in power, he is fighting our veterans in court, because they are asking for too much, but all they ever wanted was for him to keep his promise. eos sos will the prime minister do the honourable thing, and apologize for breaking his promise to veterans? eos","sos mr. speaker, we are committed to the well-being of veterans and their families. eos sos our canadian armed forces members and veterans deserve to know they will be supported should they become ill or injured. eos"
sos the hon. eos sos member for yorktonmelville. eos,"sos mr. speaker, is it possible to respect individuals and mislead them at the same time? eos sos on april 20, 2016, the prime minister said, i put forward a mandate letter to our minister of veterans affairs that asked him to respect the sacred obligation we have as a country toward those who serve. eos"
"sos it is tax-free, and provides replacement income of 90% of a veteran's pre-release salary indexed annually for life for those who need it. eos sos the conservatives had 10 years to make changes that veterans were asking for, and they did nothing but close offices, ignore veterans, and leave money on the table. eos","sos mr. speaker, on december 9, 2014, in a solemn and firm tone of voice, the member for papineau said that we have a sacred obligation to our veterans. eos sos at the time, the member for papineau claimed that as prime minister he would be the ultimate champion of our veterans' honour and rights. eos"
"sos she would also have access to all veterans affairs offices, including the nine re-opened by our government, the new office in surrey, and outreach services to the north. eos sos we listened and we took action. eos","sos mr. speaker, here is what veterans have to say. eos sos donsorochan, lead counsel for equitas society, said that the government's position was astonishing and for the prime minister to stand up and say that we do not have any special obligation to veterans was completely contrary to everything he has said in parliament and everything that he said during the election campaign. eos"
"sos we continue to listen to veterans and work with them, their family members, and stakeholders across the country. eos sos in budget2016, our government invested over $5.7billion to restore access to essential services and provide better compensation for veterans. eos","sos mr. speaker, i know the parliamentary secretary cares. eos sos i know she has family members who serve, so i would ask her to put down the talking notes, stop talking about hypothetical veterans, and make this pledge to the house. eos"
"sos some hon. eos sos members: oh, oh! eos",sos order. eos sos the hon. eos
"sos it is amazing at how much light speed money flies out the liberal door for other countries, but when our veterans ask for what they are promised, the prime minister says they are asking for more than we can give them. eos sos will the prime minister apologize to veterans for that comment? eos","sos mr. speaker, i have some numbers too: $10 billion that went to veterans, 10 offices reopened that were previously closed by that government. eos sos we have made commitments to the canadian armed forces members, veterans, and their families. eos"
"sos this deal has no indigenous chapter, no gender chapter, and no improvements to the labour chapters. eos sos for all their talk, what exactly do the liberals think is progressive about the tpp? eos","sos mr. speaker, i thank the member for her hard work on the committee. eos sos this morning i informed the committee, and she will recall, that for the first time, the tpp will have an enforceable chapter for labour and the environment. eos"
sos the liberals have not said a word about how that will affect workers now arriving in canada and those who are already here. eos sos what are the liberals doing to ensure that businesses will not try to cut costs by exploiting underpaid employees rather than hiring properly trained canadian workers? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i thank my colleague for her question. eos sos canadians want an ambitious trade agenda that does not sacrifice the environment or workers. eos"
sos something smells fishy. eos sos when are the liberals going to stop turning a blind eye to money from tax havens? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government is legislating and strictly regulating access to cannabis to keep it out of the hands of our youth. eos sos we are taking action today to keep profits out of the hands of criminals. eos"
"sos that means it is impossible to know who the investors are, although we know that many liberal cronies have both hands in the cookie jar. eos sos can the prime minister table a list of investors in the house, or will we be forced to demand eos",sos order. eos sos the hon. eos
"sos in the united states, the number has gone all the way down to 28%, in states that have legalized it. eos sos we want 0%. eos","sos mr. speaker, provinces, municipalities, police services, and health authorities are all struggling with unanswered questions to meet the prime minister's deadline for the legalization of marijuana. eos sos meanwhile, quebec media reports say hundreds of millions of dollars are flowing anonymously into canadian marijuana companies from tax havens, and by companies connected to liberal insiders. eos"
sos the previous tactics did not work. eos sos we want to see 0% in the hands of organized crime. eos,"sos mr. speaker, yesterday, the prime minister patted himself on the back for the money he claimed was going toward fighting offshore tax evasion. eos sos we know that most of the $24.5 billion that the cra says it plans to find will mostly be domestic, and will probably never be collected. eos"
sos no number is low enough for us. eos sos we want 0%. eos,sos i am sure the hon. eos sos member for chilliwack hope and others know the standing order that provides that we are not to interrupt when someone else has the floor and we are to wait until we have the floor before we speak around here. eos
sos the indonesian parliament is about to criminalize lgbtq communities by subjecting them to sentences of up to 12 years in prison. eos sos has the government made any attempt to convince the indonesian government not to go ahead with this major setback for lgbtq rights? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government is an ardent defender of lgbtq2 rights in canada and around the world. eos sos that is why we appointed a special adviser on lgbtq2 issues, my colleague. eos"
"sos this will place our family, friends, and more than 20 million indonesians at risk of discrimination and violence. eos sos will the prime minister join me in expressing concern directly to indonesia's president about this attack on lgbtq rights and safety? eos","sos mr. speaker, the promotion and protection of the human rights of all people is essential to our international engagement, and we will always condemn the persecution of lgbtq2 communities and individuals, wherever it takes place around the world. eos sos we have been a tireless advocate for the lgbtq2 community. eos"
"sos an impacted family member said, i always thought canada did not discriminate against people because they are different . eos sos will the minister adopt my private member's bill as a government bill and end this injustice? eos","sos mr. speaker, i thank the hon. eos sos member for her work on this really important issue. eos"
"sos since the budget is going to be tabled shortly, could we have some indication of when we can expect a balanced budget? eos sos will it be in 2019, as they promised, will it be in 2045, as the finance department projects, or does no one know, as the prime minister has previously said? eos","sos mr. speaker, i thank my colleague for his question, because it gives me an opportunity to remind members that we made a very clear commitment to canadians during the election campaign. eos sos that commitment was to invest in our economy, in infrastructure, and in progressive programs like the canada child benefit, which is lifting 300,000children out of poverty and has helped canada post its highest growth in 15years. eos"
"sos the deficit is twice what they promised, and the budget will not be balanced until a quarter-century after they said it would. eos sos will next year's budget deficit stay under $6 billion, as the prime minister promised? eos","sos mr. speaker, i would like to hear the member say that to christine lagarde, the president of the international monetary fund, who said that canada's approach with regard to its economy under this government should go viral, because when interest rates are low and when the economy was sluggish, like the one we inherited from the conservatives, it is good to make smart investments, to invest in infrastructure, invest in the future, invest in innovation, and invest in our communities, which is what we have done. eos sos the results speak for themselves, with close to 600,000 jobs created in the last two years. eos"
sos we stand on the side of the working-class taxpayer who has to pay bills in this country. eos sos when will the government do the same? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i wonder who was the working-class canadians they were thinking about when they doubled the tfsa limit, which would have benefited the wealthiest
              
                some hon. eos sos members: oh, oh! eos"
sos the hon. eos sos parliamentary secretary. eos,"sos mr. speaker, i wonder how many of their constituents have $11,000 at the end of the year to put in their tfsa limit? eos sos they cheered for that, just like they cheered for sending cheques to families of millionaires. eos"
"sos canada has several talent-rich sectors, which means that our country is well positioned to be a future leader. eos sos can the parliamentary secretary to the minister of innovation, science and economic development explain what the government is doing to capitalize on our talents? eos","sos mr. speaker, i thank my friend, the member for pierrefondsdollard, for his question. eos sos we committed to investing up to $950million to grow our innovation sector, and we received some bold, ambitious strategies to revitalize our regional economies. eos"
"sos at a time when nations should be coming together, the government on the mainland pushes ahead with its anti-taiwan actions without even a respectful pause. eos sos can the government update the house on how canada is helping taiwan in its time of need, and explain why it has yet to join most other nations in expressing public acknowledgement of and solidarity with those killed in this tragedy? eos","sos mr. speaker, certainly we extend our deepest sympathies, as have members of our government in the house, to the people of taiwan. eos sos at the same time, we are moving forward with an ambitious agenda to build a stronger relationship with china. eos"
"sos a promise is one thing, but a signed contract would be even better. eos sos when will the liberal government stop twiddling its thumbs, keep its promise, and bring back hundreds of good jobs for the quebec city region? eos","sos mr. speaker, the davie shipyard is a major shipyard and we recognize the expertise of its workers. eos sos they did an excellent job delivering the asterix. eos"
sos we can and must close this unacceptable gap that exists. eos sos can the minister of indigenous services please update the house on how jordan's principle is being fully implemented to address these issues? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we are absolutely committed to ensuring that no first nations child goes without the care he or she needs. eos sos since november 2015, we have been able to approve 33,000 new requests for children under jordan's principle, with over 99% approval rate. eos"
sos the fact that that money comes from tax havens does not seem to be a problem. eos sos when will the liberals put the public interest ahead of their friends' interests? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the current approach to cannabis is not working. eos sos it has allowed criminals to profit and has not kept cannabis out of the hands of our children. eos"
sos when will it stop rewarding tax evasion? eos sos is it waiting for all of our newspapers to shut down? eos,"sos mr. speaker, local information is very important for our government and, of course, it is essential to our democracy. eos sos that is why we have reinvested in our public broadcaster, cbc/radio-canada, which has extended its coverage to communities like those in the magdalen islands. eos"
sos we shall see. eos sos can the government house leader share the government's plans for the rest of the week and for the week following our constituency week? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i would like to thank the opposition house leader for the thursday question. eos sos today was a great day for canadians as we announced our supercluster strategy, and i am sure they appreciated hearing those results. eos"
sos the hon. eos sos government house leader may continue. eos,"sos upon our return following the constituency week, we will have two allotted days, the first on monday, and the other on thursday. eos sos [translation] on tuesday, we will consider billc-69, the environmental assessment act. eos"
"sos despite this never-ending drain on the taxpayers, it has come to light that 100% of seagoing fisheries and coast guard employees are impacted. eos sos when is the minister going to stop repeating empty platitudes, do her job, and fix the liberal phoenix fiasco? eos","sos mr. speaker, of course, i am happy to share that award with the previous government. eos sos it was the previous government, of course, that treated the phoenix pay system as a cost-cutting measure instead of the massive enterprise-wide initiative that it was. eos"
"sos in the house on monday, the prime minister said that an agreement had been reached to finally provide the parliamentary budget officer with the necessary documents. eos sos if that is the case, why will the prime minister not give those documents to parliamentarians in the house? eos","sos mr. speaker, we promised canadians that we would look into the tax gap, and that is exactly what we are doing. eos sos unlike our predecessors, we have opted for an evidence-based approach. eos"
sos it is written in black and white in the agreements. eos sos how can the government and the minister defend such bad agreements? eos,"sos mr. speaker, let me be clear, tax cheats can no longer hide. eos sos we are working closely with our international partners because this is a global problem for which there is no simple solution. eos"
sos is it because there are so many liberal insiders involved? eos sos why are they so irresponsible? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government is firmly committed to combatting tax evasion. eos sos that is why we invested nearly $1billion in the past two budgets. eos"
"sos they must do as they said yesterday, and truly recognize and respect indigenous rights. eos sos when will the government stop seeking to redefine and diminish the rights of these five first nations? eos","sos mr. speaker, yesterday the prime minister reaffirmed our commitment to reconciliation and a renewed nation-to-nation relationship with indigenous peoples as we look to create a recognition and implementation of rights framework. eos sos the work has already begun. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, is it the prime minister's belief that the government of india conspired and manipulated events in order to ensure the attendance of jaspal atwal, a convicted terrorist, at a reception in india last week with the prime minister? eos","sos mr. speaker, as the hon. eos sos member knows, i cannot discuss security details on the floor of the house. eos"
sos this is a very serious allegation. eos sos what proof does the prime minister have that the government of india did this? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i can say that the invitation that was issued to this particular individual, mr. atwal, should never have been issued. eos sos indeed, as soon as it was discovered, it was rescinded by the government of canada. eos"
"sos this briefing happened. eos sos the prime minister needs to tell canadians if this allegation against the indian government is believed to be true, and if so, where is the proof? eos","sos mr. speaker, again, i make the very strong point that all of the police and security officers and agencies of the government of canada in dealing with this issue have done their job in the national interest, and they have done it extraordinarily well. eos"
"sos i have no doubt that they did an excellent job, but does the prime minister listen to those security agencies, and why was that person there? eos sos the liberals need to stop blaming india. eos","sos mr. speaker, again let me make the point that as soon as the invitation to this particular individual was discovered, it was rescinded by the government of canada. eos sos let me also quote the headline from the times of india on saturday, which reads, canada's tough stand on terror soothes india . eos"
"sos if india issued the invitation, the liberals need to table documents in the house that come from india. eos sos otherwise, the prime minister needs to accept responsibility and say he made a mistake by allowing that individual to be invited. eos","sos mr. speaker, the record is clear. eos sos when this invitation was discovered, it was in fact rescinded by the government of canada. eos"
"sos these unfair duties could cripple this industry and put hundreds of good-paying, family-supporting jobs on vancouver island at risk, and possibly thousands more indirectly. eos sos what is the liberal government going to do to stand up to unfair u.s. trade practices? eos","sos mr. speaker, the department of commerce decision on supercalendered paper did not comply with the nafta panel's decision. eos sos we have therefore requested that a nafta panel review the determination by the department of commerce, and we will be challenging this decision on the world trade organization rules. eos"
"sos quebec is one of the world's biggest pulp and paper producers, and a good many jobs depend on that sector, including jobs in my region, the eastern townships. eos sos will the government stand up and defend the thousands of jobs that depend on this key industry? eos","sos mr.speaker, the department of commerce decision on supercalendered paper did not comply with the nafta panel's decision. eos sos that is why we have requested that a nafta panel review the determination by the department of commerce as soon as possible. eos"
"sos [english] as canadians and visitors from around the globe celebrated canada's 150th, it is my understanding that in the province of quebec alone we set a new record of almost 3.1 million. eos sos can the minister of small business and tourism update this house on last year's record-setting tourism year? eos","sos mr. speaker, as my colleague from the riding of montarville said, i am very proud to announce that last year was a banner year for canadian tourism. eos sos we welcomed more than 20.8million international visitors, with record numbers from all over the world. eos"
sos how could they ever have thought that this was an acceptable outcome for our seniors? eos sos how will the minister explain this mess to our vulnerable seniors? eos,"sos mr. speaker, as we do with all investments under the ica, we are actively monitoring cedar tree, because it has made a number of commitments in its takeover of the seniors homes. eos sos we are monitoring those commitments. eos"
sos when will the government apologize for allowing that to happen and for allowing communist china to become the landlords of b.c. eos sos 's vulnerable seniors? eos,"sos mr. speaker, while the opposition might engage in scare tactics and fearmongering, let us talk about the facts. eos sos the day-to-day operations of the seniors homes remain under the control of cedar tree. eos"
"sos however, this is not the first time canada's justice system has failed indigenous women and girls. eos sos how can families have any hope in the face of another heartbreaking injustice for indigenous women and girls? eos","sos mr. speaker, our hearts go out with deepest sympathies to the family, the friends, and the whole community of tina fontaine. eos sos tina's death put a face to the ongoing tragedy of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. eos"
"sos however, i am wondering if somebody on that side might be able to explain what the whole point of the trip was. eos sos he spent eight days in india, with over eos",sos the hon. eos sos minister of science. eos
"sos the prime minister welcomed more than $1 billion in investments between canadian and indian companies, which will lead to the creation of almost 6,000 good, well-paying, middle-class jobs for canadians. eos sos we know our deep canada-india ties create high-quality jobs in both countries. eos","sos mr. speaker, i am sorry, but companies in india have not invested $1billion in canada. eos sos the figure is actually $250million, and those investments would likely have been made anyway. eos"
"sos the prime minister welcomed more than $1 billion in investments between canadian and indian companies, which will lead to the creation of good, well-paying, middle-class jobs for canadians. eos sos we know the deep ties between canada and india create high-quality jobs eos",sos the hon. eos sos member for durham. eos
"sos will someone in government, if not the prime minister himself, rise and tell us whether the budget will be balanced? eos sos or, on the contrary, will the government continue to spend millions of dollars, as the prime minister shamefully did last week in india? eos","sos mr. speaker, with all due respect to my esteemed colleague, and i have a lot of respect for him, i do not think he understood the theory. eos sos the theory is that it is much easier to balance the budget when there is growth. eos"
sos they are getting all the interest payments on that debt that middle-class taxpayers have to pay in return for nothing. eos sos will the liberals keep their promise and keep the deficit below $6 billion in tomorrow's budget? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i can reassure the member, as well as all canadians, that we have always been very fiscally responsible, making sure that our debt to gdp ratio remains firmly on a downward track and that it will be at its lowest level in close to 40 years. eos sos we are in the best fiscal position in the g7. eos"
"sos eighty per cent of middle-class taxpayers are paying higher taxes today than when this prime minister took office. eos sos will the government reverse course, give a break to the middle class for a change, and stop handing our money off to the wealthy international bankers? eos","sos mr. speaker, i understand the member opposite is eager to see what is in the budget. eos sos he will have to wait until tomorrow but i can assure him that we will continue on a path that favours growth in this country and to work for the middle class, like we did when we reduced taxes for nine million canadians and when we introduced the canada child benefit, which is lifting 300,000 kids out of poverty with a more progressive approach, something that the conservatives failed to do in the decade they were in power. eos"
"sos provincial fisheries minister, gerry byrne, says it is a loss to newfoundland and labrador worth $100 million. eos sos can the minister of fisheries confirm how many jobs his decision will cost newfoundland and labrador? eos","sos mr. speaker, we are very proud of a process that we began last september to include indigenous communities in this very valuable offshore fishery. eos sos i would point out that the process to add a new entrant to this fishery was begun by the previous conservative government in 2014 and 2015, except the conservatives forgot to include indigenous communities in that process. eos"
"sos however, they did learn some interesting things, including the fact that kpmg was not touched by the agency, which is doing a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether it will or will not enforce the law. eos sos how can the minister defend this two-tier justice system? eos","sos mr. speaker, i was at the oecd last week. eos sos our government is committed to ensuring that the tax system is fair for all canadians. eos"
"sos in tomorrow's budget, the government will have a chance to start fixing what is wrong with our tax system. eos sos will we see measures to ensure that everyone is treated the same way no matter the size of people's bank accounts? eos","sos mr. speaker, access to data is key in the fight against tax evasion, and we are making considerable progress in that regard thanks to our investments. eos sos through collaboration with our international partners, the canada revenue agency now has access to better data, and, this year, the introduction of the common reporting standard has enabled us to more easily access information on the bank accounts of canadians living abroad. eos"
sos there were a host of great moments when we stood with each other and stood with pride for the contributions that all of our olympic athletes made and for canada's medal count. eos sos could the minister of sport and persons with disabilities tell us about canada's success in south korea? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our team in pyeongchang put in an outstanding performance, winning 29 medals. eos sos that is our best showing ever. eos"
sos this decision is worth millions for the company that received the quota. eos sos was the minister of fisheries aware that he awarded a benefit worth millions of dollars to the brother of one of his liberal colleagues? eos,"sos mr. speaker, what we are aware of is a valuable resource that is a public resource, that belongs to the people of canada, and that could be better shared with indigenous communities in atlantic canada and in quebec. eos sos we began an open and transparent process in september. eos"
"sos this political spectacle looks a lot like vote seeking. eos sos can the prime minister tell us how much his pointless, all-expenses-paid trip cost, especially to quebec taxpayers? eos","sos mr. speaker, unlike the opposition, we know it is important to canadians that we deliver on the world stage. eos sos while we were in india, we announced more than $1 billion in two-way investment; $7.9 million to grand challenges canada in support of women's empowerment, health, and rights; and $11.5 million to the right start initiative to empower the world's poorest women and girls. eos"
"sos however, insinuating that quebec's independence movement, a peaceful and democratic movement, is synonymous with violence tarnishes the international reputation of quebec and the millions of quebeckers who support this movement for liberty. eos sos will the prime minister apologize for the disgraceful and ill-advised comments that were reported? eos","sos mr. speaker, as the prime minister himself said, those reports are false. eos sos he never said any such thing. eos"
sos canada's national historic sites are areas that tell a unique story of our history. eos sos will the minister consider recommending the sites where people were dropped off in resolute bay and grise fiord as national historic sites? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government is committed to working respectfully with indigenous peoples to ensure national heritage places recognize indigenous traditions, cultures, history, and contributions to canada, and to fully implementing the call to action 79 from the truth and reconciliation commission. eos sos we would welcome a nomination to the historic sites and monuments board of canada to designate resolute bay and grise fiord as a national historic site. eos"
"sos [english] there are still outstanding technical issues, such as connectivity, 50% fail of euat, edp issues that are now occurring, business transformation gaps, blackout impacts, and lack of morale and capacity at pay centres. eos sos once again, i would ask for not debate but unanimous consent to provide that proof to the parliamentary secretary. eos",sos does the hon. eos sos member have the unanimous consent of the house for the tabling of documents? eos
"sos a whole season's crops cannot be delivered by rail for partisan reasons, and the minister of agriculture and agri-food is doing absolutely nothing. eos sos when will the prime minister finally do his job and take action so canada's grain producers can access the market and sell their crops? eos","sos mr. speaker, unlike the former government, which for 10 years did absolutely nothing except introduce a temporary bill, we are here for canada's grain producers. eos sos we have farmers' interests at heart. eos"
"sos now canadian farmers are literally paying the consequences for liberal inaction with the sunsetting of important provisions like extended interswitching, a rail company meeting just 17% of its grain-car orders, and now demurrage costs being passed directly to producers. eos sos will the liberals commit to reinstating extended interswitching immediately so that our canadian farmers can get their product to market? eos","sos mr. speaker, let me correct the hon. eos sos member. eos"
sos they want the government to fix it. eos sos when will the liberals actually come to the table with real solutions to end pension theft? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our heart goes out to all those affected by the closure of sears. eos sos we note that we are monitoring the situation. eos"
sos the canadian press is reporting that the prime minister's office set up a briefing with the national security adviser to raise the conspiracy theories. eos sos can the prime minister confirm this fact? eos,"sos mr. speaker, let me again say that the security officers of the government of canada, all of our police and security agencies have done their job in relation to this trip and they have done it extremely well in the canadian national interest. eos"
"sos my question is very simple. eos sos can the prime minister confirm that his office set up a media briefing with the national security adviser, where the indian government conspiracy idea was floated? eos","sos mr. speaker, again, let me repeat for the benefit of the hon. eos sos gentleman that canada has very strong, very proficient national security and police agencies. eos"
"sos then he blamed the canadian high commission, and now he is saying that the indian government invited the terrorist to derail canada-india relations. eos sos is the prime minister really suggesting that india is trying to sabotage its relationship with canada? eos","sos mr. speaker, it is very clear and the government has said for a number days that as soon as this invitation became identified, it was rescinded by the government of canada. eos sos that invitation should never have been issued in the first place. eos"
"sos is the prime minister saying that india wants to sabotage its relationship with canada? eos sos if so, let us see him table some evidence here in the house. eos","sos mr. speaker, the security interests of canada are extremely important. eos sos those interests need to rise above any partisan considerations. eos"
"sos then the prime minister forces the national security adviser to pitch a conspiracy theory to selected journalists, blaming india for trying to embarrass canada by giving a visa to a convicted terrorist. eos sos when will these liberals give some straight and honest answers to canadians? eos","sos mr. speaker, the insinuations and accusations from that member and other members of the opposition today are absolutely and utterly false. eos sos we respect our national security agencies and we respect their non-partisan public service. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, the prime minister's office forced a non-partisan public servant, the national security adviser, to plant unattributed stories in the mainstream media to try to influence and redirect stories about the prime minister's embarrassingly disastrous trip to india. eos sos does the prime minister have any evidence at all of this conspiracy theory, or was this tale concocted to protect the prime minister's political interests? eos","sos mr. speaker, the hon. eos sos gentleman is wrong. eos"
sos the heritage minister has been hearing concerns about web taxation for almost six months now. eos sos when does she think the minister of finance will hear her? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we know that the media sector is facing many upheavals because the way people consume content is changing. eos sos that is why we have made a commitment to modernize our policies so that they address digital issues. eos"

"sos the briefing to media on the jaspal atwal affair included the theory, which was advanced by a national security official, that india was somehow complicit in organizing this invitation. eos sos does the prime minister agree with those allegations? eos","sos mr. speaker, it is disappointing that the opposition does not recognize the importance of the canada-india relationship. eos sos india's growing economy offers significant opportunities to strengthen canada's middle class. eos"
"sos i would remind hon. eos sos colleagues, including the member for dufferincaledon, of the rule in standing order 16 against interrupting when another member is speaking. eos","sos mr. speaker, a senior security official made the allegation that the government of india was somehow complicit or involved in the jaspal atwal affair, that somehow it was motivated to embarrass the prime minister and canada by colluding to have him at the official events the prime minister was attending. eos sos a senior security official made those allegations. eos"
"sos we trust and listen to the advice and actions that they take, that they will be in the national interest, and that they will be impartial. eos sos all canadians can be proud, and should be proud, of the non-partisan work our national security agencies carry out on a daily basis. eos","sos mr. speaker, will the prime minister tell the house whether anyone in his office arranged, organized or participated in the media briefing provided to reporters that included the allegation that the government of india was somehow involved in his embarrassing blunder in india? eos"
"sos some hon. eos sos members: oh, oh! eos","sos order, please. eos sos members may have noticed before that sometimes they hear things in here they do not like, but they do not have to react and they should wait until they have the floor before they speak. eos"

"sos it is not worth going after a big company like kpmg, which has the means to defend itself, but small taxpayers who do not have the means to defend themselves get hit hard. eos sos will today's budget finally put an end to this two-tiered justice system? eos","sos mr. speaker, as the hon. eos sos member knows, we are combatting tax evasion and investing nearly $1billion to give the cra the tools it needs. eos"
sos the amazons of this world have an advantage over canadian stores like simons. eos sos will the budget put an end to that nonsense once and for all? eos,"sos mr. speaker, as we have said many times, we are not going to raise taxes on canadians, even though the ndp is asking us to do so. eos sos we are not going to raise taxes on taxpayers. eos"
"sos this is long overdue and would have the biggest impact on the lives of women. eos sos will the budget spend on concrete actions now, not just talk, to truly help women in this country get ahead? eos","sos mr. speaker, when we invest in women, we strengthen the economy for everyone. eos sos this has supported our work since we formed government two years ago. eos"
"sos now we know that india's security agencies did ask to see the guest list, where they would have detected the notorious, convicted, attempted assassin, but were refused access. eos sos it is time for the minister and the prime minister to explain this unacceptable security failure. eos","sos mr. speaker, in fact the security problem was identified. eos sos as soon as it was identified, the invitation was rescinded. eos"
"sos the rcmp and csis certainly did know that the hotel where the pm's cocktail party was held, the hotel at which the convicted attempted assassin posed for pictures with the prime minister's wife and others, was the site of a major terror attack in 2008 that left one canadian dead. eos sos why did the prime minister choose to disregard the assistance india offered and then push a conspiracy theory that has undermined relations with india? eos","sos mr. speaker, again i say with absolute certainty that the canadian security and police authorities performed their jobs in all of these circumstances exactly as they should have performed them. eos sos they provide independent, impartial, professional, non-partisan advice and information to the government of canada and the people of canada, and that is exactly what has happened in this case. eos"
"sos yesterday, we learned through the media that india had asked for the guest list for the prime minister's gala and that the canadian government refused to provide it. eos sos i would like to hear from the prime minister whether india made the request and how the government responded. eos","sos mr. speaker, the arrangements with respect to the prime minister's mission to india were very carefully prepared not only by the department of global affairs but also with the assistance of csis and the rcmp. eos sos they took all the necessary steps to ensure the security of the mission. eos"
"sos the prime minister did this to justify his disastrous trip to india, but more than that, they pushed this to the media without a single shred of evidence. eos sos will the prime minister provide the evidence, if it even exists, that supports this laughable conspiracy theory? eos","sos mr. speaker, when security officials, police officials, and representatives of our security and intelligence agencies provide information and offer advice either to the government or on occasion to the public, they perform their functions in a truly impartial and independent manner and they do so in the national interests of canada, not in the interests of any political party on any side of the house. eos"
"sos the people of trois-rivires have been waiting 25 years for passenger rail service to return and the minister has all the studies he needs to make a decision. eos sos can he tell us whether he views passenger rail service as an investment for our regions or, like the conservatives, does he view it as an unnecessary expense? eos","sos mr. speaker, as my colleague knows, passenger rail service is very important to this government. eos sos as he also knows, we are looking at the possibility of a high-frequency train for the quebec city-windsor corridor. eos"
"sos in response to today's security environment, nato has significantly increased the use of its awacs fleet, specifically in central and eastern europe, where canada leads a multinational nato mission based in latvia. eos sos could the minister of national defence update the house on the government's position with regard to the nato awacs program? eos","sos mr. speaker, i want to thank my colleague from kelownalake country for his former service as a cf-18 fighter pilot in the royal canadian air force. eos sos i was proud to announce our government's decision to rejoin nato's awacs program at the nato defence ministers' meeting earlier this month. eos"
sos the prime minister also said that the member for surrey centre extended an invitation to a convicted attempted murderer. eos sos is he saying that the member for surrey centre is complicit with the indian government in conspiring against the government of canada? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the prime minister indicated that particular member extended an invitation that never should have been extended and when the fact of that invitation became known to the government of canada and particularly the prime minister's office, that invitation was rescinded, as it should have been. eos"
"sos the other theory, which has been advanced by the national security adviser, is that this was a vast indian conspiracy set out to embarrass the prime minister. eos sos which one of those theories advanced by the liberal government is a lie? eos","sos mr. speaker, it has been said repeatedly and accurately that the invitation should never have been extended. eos sos once that invitation became known it was rescinded by the government of canada. eos"
sos we warned the prime minister and our fears have come true. eos sos does the minister believe that it is appropriate that our senior care homes across british columbia are owned by communist china? eos,"sos mr. speaker, when it comes to the cedar tree acquisition, the legally binding commitments remain in place with regard to jobs, not to close or repurpose any of the existing residences, to support expansion, which is very important, and also to abide by provincial and health regulations. eos sos we are going to make sure that these commitments are honoured. eos"
"sos on friday, we learned that officials in beijing had assumed control of anbang's assets, including canadian seniors' homes. eos sos does the minister really think that this is an acceptable situation? eos","sos mr. speaker, any decision we make goes through a rigorous and robust process under the investment canada act. eos sos we have been very clear that the legally binding commitments remain in place around jobs and making sure that we maintain a high number of jobs in canada, not to close or repurpose any of the existing residences, and to support expansion. eos"
"sos when the canada health act calls for public administration of our health care system, it does not mean from beijing. eos sos what is the minister of health doing to address this unacceptable situation? eos","sos mr. speaker, i can assure the member opposite that the specific, legally binding commitments around the health regulations will remain intact. eos sos this is something that we took precision around in terms of the investment canada act process. eos"
sos the minister of agriculture is way off track. eos sos when is he going to tell the minister of transport to stop punishing grain farmers and get our exports moving again? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the government certainly recognizes the importance of an efficient rail system for transporting grain, and we are working on that issue. eos sos that is why i was in contact with cn and cp last month and with cn this morning. eos"
"sos the liberal government is putting critical trade deals at risk, and now canadian farmers cannot even get their products to port. eos sos will the agriculture minister get off the bench and take action to ensure our farmers have adequate rail access to get their grain to market? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government recognizes the importance of an efficient and reliable rail system to transport grain for our farmers. eos sos that is why we put bill c-49 in place, unlike the previous government that did absolutely nothing for 10 years. eos"
sos the liberals have to stop blaming everybody else for their mismanagement and take definite action now. eos sos how much money and how many critical export markets are our farmers going to have to lose before the government stands up and takes action? eos,"sos mr. speaker, unlike the previous government that did nothing for 10 years, we actually brought forward bill c-49, which, by the way, that side voted against. eos sos it was intended to have fair rail legislation for the movement of grain. eos"
"sos foundations such as brain canada, whose offices are in montreal, are actively working on changing the lives of some 3.6million canadians suffering from all kinds of neurological infections. eos sos can the minister of health inform the house of her efforts to support neuroscience research across canada? eos","sos mr. speaker, i would like to thank my colleague from thrse-de blainville for his important question, his work in his riding, and his work on the health committee. eos sos we recently announced, at mcgill university, a $10-million grant to create a pan-canadian neuroscience platform in partnership with brain canada. eos"
sos the president of both companies in that consortium is the brother of the liberal member for sackvilleprestonchezzetcook. eos sos did the fisheries minister know that his liberal caucus mate's brother was the president of the consortium of companies? eos,"sos mr. speaker, what we did know is that the previous conservative government began a process in 2014-15 to bring a new entrant into this fishery. eos sos however, what we knew, which they did not know, was the importance of including indigenous people in the prosecution of that fishery. eos"
sos [english] the only way to bring peace to the syrian people is to find a political solution and ensure that those responsible for atrocities are brought to account. eos sos where is canada in pushing for such a solution? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the un security council resolution calling for a ceasefire in syria to allow humanitarian access must be implemented. eos sos we strongly condemn the brutal and targeted attacks against civilians, including in eastern ghouta. eos"
sos what were the outcomes of the minister's discussions? eos sos could we see more flights between canada and israel? eos,"sos mr. speaker, for this government, offering more choice at lower cost with better service is one of our priorities. eos sos that is why i was particularly glad to announce the expansion of the air transport agreement between israel and canada. eos"
"sos nonetheless, some concerns have been raised about the appointment of john norris to the federal court. eos sos what criteria did the minister of justice use with respect to this appointment? eos","sos mr. speaker, it gives me great pleasure to stand to talk about our robust appointment process and to celebrate the meritorious candidates who i have been able to appoint across the country, some 160 thus far. eos sos in terms of judicial candidates, i take the evaluation of the independent advisory committees that rate as recommended or highly recommended. eos"
"sos to add insult to injury, the minister of canadian heritage refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement with netflix to the government of quebec. eos sos will the minister finally be transparent, answer requests for information, and put an end to this flagrant injustice? eos","sos mr. speaker, this is a time of upheaval for the television, radio, and media industries. eos sos we have been proactive. eos"
sos they deserve a full-time advocate. eos sos when will the government act? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i am delighted to say that we have a government that is entirely dedicated to the welfare of our seniors. eos sos we started in 2016 with an increase in the guaranteed income supplement of up to $1,000 per year, benefiting almost a million vulnerable seniors. eos"
"sos there is a simple solution, however, one that the ndp has been calling for for quite some time now: a universal, affordable child care program. eos sos when is it going to happen? eos","sos mr. speaker, anyone who takes gender equality seriously knows that high-quality, affordable day care services are essential, so we know just how important day care services are, not only for parents, but also for children, and particularly children from more vulnerable families. eos sos back in 2016, we announced our plan to create up to 40,000 spaces in educational daycare centres across the country by 2028. we want better, more affordable child care for canadians. eos"
"sos he has been barred from hearing cases since 2013. in a vast court region like abitibitmiscaminguenord-du-qubec, his absence is having major repercussions on public access to justice. eos sos could the minister of justice tell us where we are in the process and whether she is planning to make a recommendation to parliament this week, so that we can act swiftly to restore access to justice? eos","sos mr. speaker, i appreciate the question being brought up. eos sos i did receive, last week, a recommendation from the canadian judicial council that recommended the removal of the judge that was referenced. eos"
"sos there are desperate needs that need to be addressed right now, and yet most of the funding will not be allocated until after the next election. eos sos when will this government stop making promises and start taking action? eos","sos mr. speaker, on the contrary, with budget2018, we are taking the next steps to improve equality, competitiveness, sustainability, and equity in canada. eos sos our budget plan will allow us to continue to invest in strengthening and growing the middle class and to lay a stronger foundation for our children's future. eos"
sos immediate funding is needed now to bridge the funding gap for women in canada. eos sos how much longer will the government make women wait to have equal pay for work of equal value? eos,"sos mr. speaker, over the past two years we have taken many different actions to help address the wage gap and support women's labour market participation, including $7 billion to address early learning and child care needs, increasing parental and maternity benefits, and implementing flexible work arrangements for federally regulated employees, and yesterday we announced that we would introduce pay equity legislation as part of the budget implementation act. eos sos we know there is much more work to do, and we intend to get it done. eos"
sos it takes money to implement all these measures. eos sos when will the government put words into action? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we have been putting words into action for the past two years. eos sos we announced $7billion to address early learning and child care needs. eos"
"sos as anyone would expect, the indian government reacted strongly to those insinuations by the prime minister and his chief adviser. eos sos if the prime minister has nothing to hide, he should table his evidence in the house. eos","sos mr. speaker, as i have often said, those of us on this side of the house have faith in our security and information services. eos sos we have already answered all these questions, but as everyone knows, the opposition would rather talk about anything but budget 2018, which is full of great initiatives for the middle class and those working hard to join it. eos"
"sos this is all very serious. eos sos if the prime minister has nothing to hide, he needs to produce the evidence to support his allegations. eos","sos mr. speaker, as i said, i have answered these questions, but while the opposition chooses to focus on me, we remain focused on canadians. eos sos we want to do more, across government, to support women. eos"
"sos which is it? eos sos if the prime minister stands behind what he said yesterday, he needs to bring us the evidence. eos","sos mr. speaker, we have already answered those questions. eos sos what the opposition fails to understand is that it should be focusing on canadians. eos"
"sos however, today, the indian government, through a foreign affairs press release, confirmed that that was absolutely false and that there was no truth to the claim. eos sos if the prime minister is maintaining his position, he should give us the evidence now. eos","sos mr. speaker, we have already answered those questions. eos sos what we are focusing on is ensuring a better future for canadians on the labour market. eos"
sos why does he not take action? eos sos why do the homeless always finish behind the super-rich for the prime minister? eos,"sos mr. speaker, on the contrary, over the past two years we have made significant investments in helping the most vulnerable in our country. eos sos we brought forward the canada child benefit that is lifting hundreds of thousands of kids out of poverty and reducing child poverty by 40%. eos"
sos our government has committed to making gender equality the focus of its decisions. eos sos can the prime minister tell the house how budget2018 will meet that commitment and enable more women to take advantage of the opportunities they deserve? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i thank the member for shefford for his question. eos sos we know that the middle class cannot grow without the full involvement of women in the labour market. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, in the aftermath of the prime minister's botched trip to india, he has actually managed to make things worse by blaming so-called factions in the indian government for the invitation extended to jaspal atwal, a claim that was swiftly denounced by india's foreign affairs ministry as baseless and unacceptable. eos sos is the prime minister trying to create an international diplomatic crisis? eos","sos mr. speaker, on this side of the house we have full confidence in the work that our national security agencies and professionals do, and we support them in their professional, non-partisan work. eos sos we will continue to respect and support the work that our intelligence agencies do, because that is what canadians expect of their government, and that is what canadians expect of all of us. eos"
"sos he could have raised some issues that are important to canadians, but no, all he managed to do was to create tension with a very important country in the region. eos sos is this how the prime minister wants to put canada back on the world stage? eos","sos mr. speaker, on the contrary, we recognize that india's thriving economy presents some significant opportunities to strengthen canada's middle class. eos sos we secured more than $1billion in investments from deals between canadian and indian companies, which will help create more than 5,800 quality jobs for canadians. eos"
sos he was punished for that yesterday. eos sos how can both of these versions be true? eos,"sos mr. speaker, unlike the member opposite, we will always defend the integrity of our senior security and intelligence officials and the excellent work that they do. eos sos unlike the previous government, we will always listen to them and respect them. eos"
"sos he has also said that it was the member for surrey centre acting alone that resulted in this embarrassing incident. eos sos how can the prime minister, at the same time, blame rogue elements in the indian government and the member for surrey centre? eos","sos mr. speaker, like most canadians on this side of the house, we respect and appreciate the work done by our professional public services, and particularly in regard to our national security agencies and information agencies. eos sos we believe them when they put forward their information and their recommendations to us. eos"
"sos if, on the one hand, it is the government of india that has implicated itself into canadian government affairs, that is a profound allegation that has serious consequences that cannot be thought about lightly just to get through a 24-hour news cycle. eos sos why is the prime minister so irresponsible about this very important bilateral issue? eos","sos mr. speaker, once again, we support and accept the counsel, the recommendations, the extraordinary work, and the advice of our national security agencies and information agencies. eos sos we support our professional public services and accept the information and recommendations they give to us. eos"
"sos by having an independent national security official brief the media anonymously right in the middle of a negative 24-hour news cycle, the prime minister has implicated the independent public service in his disastrous trip. eos sos will the prime minister confirm or deny that anyone in his office orchestrated the briefing to shift the blame on this? eos","sos mr. speaker, i am going to have to explain this to the members opposite, who did not learn this through 10 years of government. eos sos we saw that regularly in their behaviour in the harper years. eos"
"sos the prime minister needs to learn that there are serious consequences to these types of allegations, that governing is more than just instagram posts, and that when one makes this kind of allegation, there are consequences. eos sos will the prime minister identify who in his office orchestrated this media briefing? eos","sos mr. speaker, perhaps it would be helpful to folks here if the member opposite actually were to state whether or not he believes that the professional public servant, who functions in a non-partisan way, was not telling the truth or was not clear on what he was saying. eos sos this is the issue that the member opposite seems to be getting at, that he does not believe our professional public servants in what they tell canadians. eos"
"sos in december, he met with joshua boyle, who, days later, was charged with sexual assault and unlawful confinement. eos sos why is it always that the prime minister seems to be identified with these kinds of people? eos","sos mr. speaker, once again, the member opposite is not being clear. eos sos he has not come forward to say whether or not he actually believes
              
                some hon. eos"
sos the right hon. eos sos prime minister has the floor. eos,"sos mr. speaker, if the members opposite do not trust or believe our national security agencies, they should simply come forward and say so. eos sos on this side of the house, we have faith in our professional public servants, particularly in the intelligence and security areas, who do extraordinary work every day to keep canadians safe, and the members opposite should stop disrespecting them. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, the new ei parental sharing benefit represents a major step forward in helping parents balance work and parental responsibilities, as they welcome new children into their family. eos sos could the prime minister explain how this greater choice and flexibility in parental and maternity benefits will help parents provide their children with the best possible start in life? eos","sos mr. speaker, too often working mothers pull double duty, working a full-time job during the day, then going home and doing the bulk of parenting duties at night. eos sos moving away from this second shift will take time, and it begins by helping parents share the work of raising their children more equally with the new parental sharing benefit. eos"
"sos the time for universal pharmacare is now. eos sos why is the prime minister even bothering with another long consultation, when his finance minister has already spilled the beans on the outcome? eos","sos mr. speaker, every year almost one million canadians give up food and heat to afford the medicine they need. eos sos the high cost of prescription medication means that sometimes sick canadians must do without. eos"
sos this is a diplomatic matter. eos sos what will he say to the high commissioner to canada from india in response to its missive? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the conservatives seem to think it is a problem that the headline is prime minister stands by his officials. eos sos this is something that we need to understand. eos"
sos it is even giving up revenue by protecting tax havens for the super-rich and allowing internet giants to avoid collecting taxes. eos sos why is the prime minister working harder for tax havens than for quebeckers? eos,"sos mr. speaker, with respect to the davie shipyard, we know what great work davie workers have been doing for a long time. eos sos that is why we are happy to be in talks for the new icebreakers the canadian coast guard needs. eos"
sos may i ask if the right hon. eos sos prime minister would please update the house as to our government's commitment to reconciliation and inclusion of the mtis nation and canada's growth and prosperity? eos,"sos mr. speaker, reflecting commitments in the canada-mtis nation accord, budget 2018 proposes to invest $516 million over 10 years for housing, post-secondary education, and health strategies. eos sos president chartrand of the manitoba mtis federation said, since confederation, the mtis nation has been left out in the cold. eos"
"sos do not just stare at them; that is weird. eos sos after 21 years, the evidence is clear, why does the prime minister continue to refuse to implement pharmacare now in canada? eos","sos mr. speaker, it is disappointing to hear the member opposite disparage a national housing strategy because in addition to housing investment from budget 2016, it represents a 12-year commitment to housing and 30% of that 12-year investment will be spent in the first four years of our mandate. eos sos investment then increases gradually over time because unlike previous governments, we believe the community housing sector should grow, not sink. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, the prime minister wants to talk about the budget. eos sos in what year will it be balanced? eos","sos mr. speaker, in the last election, canadians were given a choice between investment and austerity. eos sos canadians chose investment, and it worked. eos"
"sos he said that next year the budget would be balanced, and now we learn that it will not be for another quarter of a century, during which time he will add, or some future government will add, a half a trillion dollars in debt, presuming there is no more spending. eos sos once again, when will the budget be balanced? eos","sos mr. speaker, under the harper government, the conservatives added $150 billion to our national debt and had no growth to show for it. eos sos the worst growth rates since the great depression were under stephen harper. eos"
"sos i will ask for a third time, and maybe this time the prime minister can answer the question. eos sos in what year will the budget be balanced? eos","sos mr. speaker, when liberals presented a plan for investment instead of the austerity plan the conservatives were presenting, canadians supported us because they knew we would invest while maintaining fiscal discipline. eos sos we have the lowest debt-to-gdp ratio in the g7, better than the u.s., better than the uk, better than germany, and it is decreasing every single year. eos"
sos canada is the number one supplier of aluminum and steel to the united states. eos sos can the prime minister update the house on whether or not he has confirmed with the president of the united states that canada will be exempt from these tariffs? eos,"sos mr. speaker, as canadians would expect, we are following the situation very carefully. eos sos any tariffs or quota that would be imposed on our canadian steel and aluminum industries would be unacceptable. eos"
sos the liberals plan to go forward with a means-tested system. eos sos why is the government putting together this advisory council if it already knows what it wants to do? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we were very pleased to put forward a committee to take a look at how we can ensure that we deal with getting pharmaceutical products to all canadians. eos sos we are going to look for expert advice to tell us how best to do this. eos"
"sos canadians need universal pharmacare now. eos sos will the prime minister remove the minister of finance from the discussions, and can he assure us that the consultation is not just a stalling tactic? eos","sos mr. speaker, we are proud to be looking into exactly what we need to do to make sure every canadian gets the medication they need. eos sos we have decided to put forward an advisory committee to determine how we should proceed. eos"
"sos stealing our ideas would help people, but sabotaging our ideas never helps anyone. eos sos why do the interests of canadian families always come second to the interests of morneau shepell and the mega-wealthy? eos","sos mr. speaker, that is a bizarre question. eos sos we think that the idea of actually having experts help us to come forward with a way that we can get pharmaceuticals to all canadians is important. eos"
sos the prime minister has not stolen the ndp plan; he has vandalized it. eos sos why will the government not bring in real universal pharmacare now? eos,"sos mr. speaker, canadians are proud of our publicly funded universal medicare system, one based on the individual's need and not the ability to pay, yet we recognize that there is certainly room for improvement. eos sos we have created a national advisory committee on the implementation of pharmacare with its mandate to study, evaluate, and ultimately bring recommendations to government on possible options. eos"
sos why is the prime minister clinging to this preposterous theory that it was the indian government? eos sos why is the liberal government levying unfounded attacks on our friend in india when one of its own caucus members has accepted responsibility? eos,"sos mr. speaker, as we have been saying all along, this invitation should never have been sent. eos sos once we were made aware of this individual's background, the invitation was rescinded. eos"
"sos even the prime minister's friend, jaspal atwal, has called the indian conspiracy claims a lie. eos sos to stop the diplomatic bleeding, will the prime minister retract his remarks? eos","sos mr. speaker, the prime minister has been pre-eminently clear in our trust for our non-partisan public service. eos sos we stand behind them, full force. eos"
"sos second, he felt the need to punish one of his mps for having invited terrorist jaspal atwal to the event organized by canada's high commission in india. eos sos does this mean that the member and the government are plotting to undermine canada? eos","sos mr. speaker, the same questions get the same answers. eos sos we have full confidence in the public service and in the work our public servants do every day. eos"
"sos if that is the case, he should submit some evidence, because india is saying the opposite. eos sos does my colleague have any evidence to confirm that india actually did something to undermine canada? eos","sos mr. speaker, i totally reject the assertions made by the member opposite. eos sos the invitation was sent, and when we received information that there was a problem, the invitation was immediately rescinded. eos"
"sos for the prime minister, how can these two things both be true? eos sos when will the prime minister stop hiding the facts, and show us the evidence? eos","sos mr. speaker, i know three things. eos sos first, when the individual in question was found out, and the information was there, the invitation was rescinded, and the member of parliament apologized. eos"
"sos liberal caucus chair, independently or otherwise, for something the prime minister himself said he believed the indian government did? eos sos this is all as ridiculous, damaging, and disastrous as the trip was itself, and these liberals should be ashamed. eos","sos mr. speaker, i have answered the question very clearly. eos sos once we found out that information, the individual's invitation was rescinded, and the member apologized, but i reject totally the assertion that was made about the trip. eos"
"sos we need leaders who are 100% focused on canadians' needs, not their own needs or those of their party. eos sos when will we find out the true purpose of the trip? eos","sos mr. speaker, i thank my colleague for her question. eos sos the prime minister of canada's trip was about strengthening canada's cultural and economic ties. eos"
"sos those allegations made in parliament did enormous damage to canada's credibility and to the prime minister's credibility. eos sos will the prime minister provide parliament with the evidence in a briefing, or is this him using the donald trump damage control playbook of self-serving political pinocchio-ism? eos","sos mr. speaker, as i have said, and i will reiterate, the invitation sent was rescinded when the information found out was that the individual should never have received that invitation. eos sos the member in question has apologized, and we have full and total confidence in our national security infrastructure and the non-partisan advice they give us. eos"
"sos although we have seen significant progress, there is still progress to be made in ensuring real gender equality. eos sos as we approach international women's day, could the parliamentary secretary to the minister of status of women please tell the house how budget 2018 will contribute to helping close the gaps and ensuring women have real equal opportunities to succeed? eos","sos mr. speaker, as we get set to celebrate the contributions and achievements of women on international women's day, i am pleased to say that our government is taking concrete actions toward gender equality by putting gender at the heart of decision-making by legislating gender-based analysis plus, recognizing the important role of status of women canada by making it a full department, and investing $100 million for a strong, sustainable women's movement. eos sos when women succeed, we all succeed, and our economy succeeds. eos"
sos when will the prime minister recognize that his globetrotting selfies and his photo-op tours are doing nothing to help canadians? eos sos when will he get to work to act on the real challenges that people in churchill and across the country are facing today? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government remains committed to the people of churchill and northern manitoba. eos sos we recognize the importance of that rail line for that community. eos"
sos investment is fleeing and they have impeded the opportunity for investment. eos sos why are the liberals putting up so many roadblocks for indigenous economic prosperity? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i am very pleased to answer this question and to talk about things like the housing investments that were made in our federal budget this week. eos sos we have investments of $500 million for mtis housing, $400 million for inuit housing, and $200 million every single year for first nations housing. eos"
sos budget 2018 reiterates our government's commitment to fighting tax evasion and avoidance. eos sos can the minister of national revenue inform the house of the new measures that make our tax system fairer? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i would like to thank my colleague from lac-saint-jean for being a strong voice for the regions of quebec. eos sos in the past two years, we have done quite a lot to fight those who avoid paying their fair share of taxes. eos"
"sos this is the shipyard that delivered the asterix on time. eos sos when will the prime minister keep his word and start converting the four icebreakers, move forward with converting the obelix, and include the davie shipyard in canada's national shipbuilding strategy? eos","sos mr. speaker, i thank my hon. eos sos colleague for everything he is doing for workers at the davie shipyard. eos"
sos will the government acknowledge that we must immediately adopt the solution used by almost every oecd country? eos sos that takes piecemeal agreements with multi-nationals. eos,"sos mr. speaker, we know that the media sector is facing many upheavals because consumer habits are changing. eos sos that is why we have made a commitment to modernize our policies so that they address digital issues. eos"
sos can the hon. eos sos minister of indigenous services please update this house on what our government is doing to champion indigenous children's welfare? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i want to thank the hon. eos sos member for st. john's east for his advocacy on this issue. eos"

sos when will the government give davie its fair share of contracts? eos sos is it waiting until condos take over the shipyards? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the government is definitely taking steps to provide the canadian coast guard with the ships it needs to serve the canadian people. eos sos the government is pleased to be working with the davie shipyard, which did very good work on the asterix, to find a solution that will meet our icebreaking needs. eos"

"sos the parliamentary budget officer requested a new plan, but it does not exist. eos sos how is it even possible to spend $186 billion without a plan? eos","sos mr. speaker, the member opposite would not understand what an infrastructure plan is, because they never had one. eos sos we put forward a plan that is helping us build a better public transportation system. eos"

sos the hon. eos sos minister of infrastructure and communities has the floor. eos,"sos mr. speaker, the opposition may find it funny, but it is very important for people in halifax and people in red deer and to understand that those buses are improving their quality of life. eos sos it is helping to reduce gridlock in those communities, helping to get students from home to university or colleges, and getting workers home safely to their families. eos"
"sos what about the props, sets, and extensive archives in radio-canada's custody? eos sos i realize that radio-canada is an independent corporation, but is the minister of canadian heritage being kept abreast of how these public collections are being disposed of? eos","sos mr. speaker, as my colleague mentioned, cbc/radio canada operates independently. eos sos that being said, we are always prepared to support any good initiative from the sector to protect our heritage. eos"
sos i am wondering if the minister could update us on his efforts to remove these people from the country. eos sos will he pledge to do so as expeditiously as possible? eos,"sos mr. speaker, the issue is a serious one, and we are applying all efforts to deal with the backlog. eos sos the backlog of people awaiting removal ballooned under the former government to over 20,000, and two-thirds of current cases date back to the harper era. eos"
"sos as of now, there are exactly 1,167 such individuals in the country, and they are a threat to the public. eos sos when will the prime minister order their immediate deportation? eos","sos mr. speaker, in the last budget, the minister of finance made additional resources available to cbsa. eos sos that effort will continue going forward. eos"
sos there is nothing to counter the housing crisis. eos sos when will the government put its feminist words into action? eos,"sos mr.speaker, i am proud to be part of a government that is working hard for the middle class and helping more canadians join it, particularly from a gender equality perspective, as women have an important role to play in leading this inclusive growth. eos sos over the last two years, we have implemented major policies that are transforming the quality and accessibility of child care, as well as a canada child benefit that primarily benefits women across canada. eos"
"sos obviously, he and his friends are the only ones benefiting from this economic growth. eos sos how can the minister of finance assess our country's economy for canadians when he does not even have a tool for calculating and assessing the consequences and risks of canadians' household debt? eos","sos mr. speaker, if the opposition member takes a look at our record over the past two years, he will see that we have made a sustained effort to reduce inequality and to ensure that those who need it most have the most at the end of the month. eos sos one example in budget2018 is the new canada workers benefit, which will help lift tens of thousands of low-income workers out of poverty. eos"
"sos luckily, olivia has her family to fight for her, and fight government bureaucracy every three months for access to this life-saving medication. eos sos why is the liberal health minister making access to life-saving medications difficult for most vulnerable canadians? eos","sos mr. speaker, our government recognizes the importance of canadians having access to safe effective treatment such as cystagon for rare diseases. eos sos we are committed to improving the affordability, accessibility, and the appropriate use of medication, and have proposed amendments to the patented medicines regulations in order to prevent excessive prices for patented drugs, including those for rare diseases. eos"

"sos vulnerable canadians with sma are at the mercy of bureaucrats and the health minister, who are ignoring the evidence. eos sos will the minister commit to overruling her bureaucrats so that evan and other sma patients can get the medicine they need? eos","sos mr. speaker, health canada is committed to providing access to safe and effective therapeutic products, including products to meet the needs of patients with rare diseases. eos sos spinraza was reviewed as a priority and approved for treatment for patients with spinal muscular atrophy in the summer of 2017. as with all medications, the responsibility for decisions regarding funding and reimbursement lies primarily with provinces and territories. eos"
sos this is not an isolated case. eos sos why does this government ignore vulnerable canadians? eos,"sos mr.speaker, our government is committed to improving access to necessary prescription drugs and ensuring that products on the canadian market remain of the highest quality. eos sos to that end, our department has recently launched an initiative to improve the regulatory review of drugs and devices. eos"
"sos we know that the government supports seasonal workers, that it reversed the changes made to the ei system by the previous government, and that it announced targeted funding in budget 2018 to support affected seasonal workers. eos sos can the minister of families, children and social development explain to the house how the government is committed to helping these vulnerable canadians? eos","sos mr. speaker, i would like to begin by thanking the member for miramichigrand lake and all members of the house who have worked so hard on this issue in recent weeks. eos sos we signed an agreement with the government of new brunswick this morning to support workers in seasonal industries and provide them with assistance through income support, professional training, and work experience for the benefit of their families, their businesses, and their communities. eos"
"sos he and numerous indigenous groups are demanding a full review of the whole process and transparency in all the bids. eos sos for the sake of transparency and confidence in the process, would the minister commit to tabling all the surf clam bids and the criteria he used in selecting his colleague's brother for the winning bid? eos","sos mr. speaker, let me first welcome our colleague back to the house of commons. eos sos it is great to see him with us in good health. eos"
"sos the ndp has been pushing for better protection of canadians' personal data for years, but the liberals refuse to act. eos sos how many more cases will the liberals wait for before protecting canadians? eos","sos mr.speaker, protecting canadians' money and canada's democratic institutions from cyber threats and foreign interference is a top priority for this government. eos sos we work with platforms to ensure that they fulfill their responsibilities to protect the integrity of our democracy and our elections. eos"
"sos like everyone who watched the paralympic games, i can also say that greatness is magnificent. eos sos can the minister of science and minister of sport and persons with disabilities tell us how our athletes did in pyeongchang? eos","sos mr.speaker, i had the opportunity to be in pyeongchang to see our canadian athletes give their best. eos sos it was an experience i will never forget. eos"
"sos when will he help the shipyard workers get back to work? eos sos he must not deprive the coast guard of the msaiviq, an icebreaker that is available and that would help the coast guard fulfill its mandate. eos","sos mr. speaker, we are continuing our discussions with davie to meet the coast guard's need for icebreaker services. eos sos we will inform the house when those discussions and negotiations are complete, but right now we are looking at the numbers and working with davie. eos"
"sos he is talking from experience, after living through the un debacle in rwanda, with awful rules of engagement and bureaucratic chains of command. eos sos will the prime minister come clean about the un rules of engagement and the chain of command our troops are going to be under in this dangerous mission in mali? eos","sos mr. speaker, the safety of our canadian armed forces members is the utmost priority. eos sos as i have always stated, anywhere we send our members, we make sure that they have, with the proper mandate, the appropriate equipment, the appropriate training, and the rules of engagement. eos"
sos she understands the danger and the risk of this deadly peacekeeping mission. eos sos will the prime minister admit that the un deployment is more about his personal political aspirations than it is in canada's national interest? eos,"sos mr. speaker, since the member opposite is quoting members like romo dallaire, i had the privilege of asking romo dallaire and louise arbour to accompany me on my fact-finding mission to africa, five different countries, where i got to learn from their experience. eos sos we have taken that into account. eos"
"sos however, there is no peace to keep in mali; it is a war zone. eos sos can the prime minister confirm that mali is a war zone, yes or no? eos","sos mr. speaker, canada has a long tradition of co-operation and leadership on the international stage. eos sos canadians can be proud of the initiatives led by canada that contribute to peace and security and increase the effectiveness of un peacekeeping operations. eos"
"sos when the united nations oversees military operations, it is always chaos. eos sos are we sending canadian troops into a country that is at war and descending into chaos, yes or no? eos","sos mr. speaker, i want to reassure all canadians that the lives of our canadian military personnel are absolutely precious. eos sos our decision to take on this mission was carefully thought out and we intend to take the time to diligently plan the deployment. eos"
"sos the minister wants to consult and regulate because she knows full well that highly sweetened, high-alcohol beverages are dangerous. eos sos will she use her common sense and suspend the sale of these beverages until new regulations are put in place? eos","sos mr. speaker, the health and safety of canadians is our top priority. eos sos as i said yesterday, our thoughts are with ms.gervais's family. eos"
"sos in the past 24 hours, we have visited convenience stores in our ridings, and several of these brands can still be bought by our young people. eos sos why is the minister refusing to act responsibly and suspend the sale of these products while regulations are being drafted? eos","sos mr. speaker, banning a specific product will not resolve the general problem they pose. eos sos i am also deeply troubled by the availability of highly sweetened, high-alcohol drinks that are sold in large, single-serve containers. eos"
"sos mr. speaker, i rise on a point of order in reference to a question that was answered by the minister of public safety. eos sos i have in my hands a report from the canada border services agency, from november 2017, that says the number of deportations has declined dramatically in the last five years: 18,992 in 2012, with the good government, and 7,364 in 2016. i would like to table the document. eos",sos does the hon. eos sos member have unanimous consent of the house to table the document? eos

"sos even more importantly, the u.s. department of commerce has instructed that the duty be applied and taken over in cash deposit. eos sos i would like to know from the minister whether or not the government has a plan, and please do not tell me that the plan is to buy more buses. eos","sos mr. speaker, we absolutely have a plan in dealing with all actions by the commerce department against the canadian forestry industry, and we have been demonstrating that on all of our forestry files. eos sos when it comes to uncoated groundwood paper, we are deeply disappointed with these preliminary rates. eos"
"sos as the weeks go by, the government is sitting back, watching the world turn, and there is no agreement in sight, unless there is something the liberals are not telling us. eos sos what are the prime minister and his minister going to do to get the industry out of this awful situation and help canadian families? eos","sos mr. speaker, we are deeply disappointed in the u.s. department of commerce's unjustified decision to impose preliminary duties. eos sos we are well aware that the canadian forestry industry sustains excellent middle-class jobs. eos"

"sos the minister has even stated that she will not re-evaluate the existing arms export permits, despite evidence of human rights violations. eos sos how can the government claim to have a progressive and feminist foreign policy when it continues to sell weapons to saudi arabia? eos","sos mr. speaker, we condemn any and all human rights violations. eos sos canada's export control system is one of the strictest in the world. eos"
"sos the liberals like to brag about standing up for our culture in negotiations. eos sos if that is true, then why is the tpp cultural exemption in a side letter and not in the main agreement? eos","sos mr. speaker, protecting the cultural exemption is a priority for our government, as demonstrated by our negotiation of the asia-pacific trade agreement. eos sos unlike the previous government, we really have stood up for our cultural institutions. eos"
sos i have one perfectly simple question for the prime minister: when will we return to a balanced budget? eos sos on what date? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i want to remind my colleague from louis-saint-laurent that two years ago, canadians had to choose between the austerity proposed by the conservatives and the program that our government put forward, which was to invest in our infrastructure, in our communities, in a fairer and more equitable society. eos sos over the past two years, we have succeeded in lifting more than 300,000children out of poverty. eos"
"sos [english]
              one, two, three strikes you're out! eos sos [translation] when will the liberals return to a balanced budget? eos","sos mr.speaker, it is my turn to remind my hon. eos sos colleague of the facts. eos"
sos that is only $15million of the promised $1billion. eos sos where is the rest of the money? eos,"sos mr. speaker, fighting tax evasion, especially abroad, is a priority for our government. eos sos budget 2018 provides for nearly $200million in new investments to help us go even further, specifically by making legislative changes that will close the tax loopholes used by multinationals. eos"
sos is this where that $1billion is going? eos sos to maliciously prosecute the little people? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government is committed to ensuring that the cra treats canadians as important clients and not just as taxpayers. eos sos the cra undertakes a review of all court decisions in order to ensure that its programs and services are held to the highest standard. eos"
sos liberals support a profoundly unfair tax system by doing virtually nothing. eos sos when will the prime minister start taking tax evasion and tax fraud seriously? eos,"sos mr. speaker, our government promised to crack down on tax evasion. eos sos we are working with our international partners to fight tax evasion abroad by improving the exchange of information and improving our practices. eos"
"sos liberals pretend by unfairly going after people like small business owners and people with disabilities who request their tax credit, but they leave the massive tax evaders untouched. eos sos when will the government crack down on massive tax evasion that costs canadians billions of dollars? eos","sos mr. speaker, i want to make it clear that the oecd has recognized canada's leadership in using data to assess the risk of multinational corporations. eos sos canada is making sure that multinationals pay their fair share of taxes. eos"
"sos it is $210 a month, and now it will not even negotiate with the owner. eos sos when will the liberals start standing up for small businesses and get this crown corporation to pay its bill? eos","sos mr. speaker, i can assure the member and all members of the house that we are looking into this. eos sos i have asked canada post to look into this file. eos"
"sos the train is not only an ideal form of transportation for enjoying our country's beautiful landscapes, but it has also been connecting canadians across the country for decades. eos sos could the minister of transport update canadians and this house on what he has done to improve this important transportation service in the quebec city-windsor corridor? eos","sos mr. speaker, i thank my colleague from alfred-pellan for his question and for his hard work on the standing committee on transport, infrastructure and communities. eos sos our government recognizes how important the passenger rail system is here in canada. eos"
sos will he clearly condemn violence by illegal protestors? eos sos will he unequivocally support the rule of law? eos,"sos mr. speaker, public safety officers of all kinds, including particularly police officers, defend canadians on the front lines in communities from coast to coast to coast. eos sos they deserve our unequivocal support and admiration for the work they do to keep canadians safe. eos"
sos these crossings are needed to keep the public safe and to give them more mobility. eos sos will the minister of transport put the interests of the public ahead of the interests of rail companies? eos,"sos mr. speaker, i thank my colleague for her question. eos sos i remind her that there is a mechanism for people to request that the canadian transportation agency create railroad crossings. eos"
"sos i am pleased to see that budget 2018 is making investments in anti-racism initiatives. eos sos [translation]
              can the minister update this house on these initiatives aimed at ensuring a more inclusive future for all canadians? eos","sos mr. speaker, first, i would like to thank my colleague, the member for scarboroughrouge park, for his important question and his hard work. eos sos today our government reaffirmed its commitment to the fight against racism. eos"
sos can the hon. eos sos minister of transport assure us that he can get cn to do the job and deliver the grain? eos,"sos mr. speaker, after the minister of agriculture and i wrote to cn and cp and told them that we were not satisfied with the movement of grain , they came back to us with plans that involve considerably more resources in terms of crews, in terms of equipment, and in terms of prioritization for the movement of grain. eos sos we want to get our farmers' grain out to the west coast. eos"
sos canadians are demanding that the ministers of environment and fisheries issue an emergency order under the species at risk act to protect southern resident killer whales. eos sos will the government do the right thing and immediately issue an emergency order to keep these whales from being wiped from the face of this planet? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we share our colleague's concern about the importance of protecting the southern resident killer whale population in british columbia. eos sos this is an iconic species for all canadians. eos"
sos that is a lot of invitations to mr. atwal. eos sos the opposition members have one invite they would like the prime minister to make: invite the national security adviser to the public safety committee so we can get answers. eos,"sos mr. speaker, the answer with respect to the invitation is already very clear. eos sos the invitation should never have been issued, and when that invitation was discovered, it was immediately rescinded. eos"
"sos however, the indian government, mr.atwal, the minister of foreign affairs, and the liberal member for surrey centre all deny those claims. eos sos will our transparent prime minister provide elected officials with the same debriefing that was given to the media, and allow us to call daniel jean to appear before the standing committee on public safety? eos","sos mr. speaker, on the issue of the invitation, which is obviously the core element in the question that has just been asked, the answer is abundantly clear. eos sos the invitation should not have been extended. eos"
"sos either circumstance is very serious. eos sos i ask you, mr. speaker, to put your investigative powers and skills to work to resolve this conflict and ascertain which of those two unacceptable circumstances arose today in the house of commons. eos",sos i thank the hon. eos sos member for carleton for raising this. eos
sos we have learned that service canada will no longer refer to clients as  mr. or mrs.  in its communications. eos sos can the prime minister tell us why this bad joke has become a government directive? eos,"sos mr. speaker, let us be clear. eos sos service canada will continue to use mr. and mrs.. service canada will continue to talk to canadians and treat them respectfully, regardless of their identity, as part of its commitment to diversity and inclusion. eos"
"sos colleague, the minister of fisheries, oceans and the canadian coast guard. eos sos by not tabling the rfp that has been asked for in recent days and the criteria used in awarding one of his colleague's brothers this lucrative contract, he is impeding our job as members of parliament. eos","sos i thank the member for caribooprince george for raising his point. eos sos while, at first glance, it sounds to me more like a matter of debate, i will look into and examine the matter and come back to the house if necessary. eos"
"sos the prime minister when he was in opposition. eos sos if asking questions is essential to democracy, why is the prime minister obstructing the democratic process by refusing to let daniel jean appear before the public safety committee? eos","sos mr. speaker, the central issue raised in the motion that is before the house today has to do with the invitation that was extended to a certain individual. eos sos the mp for surrey centre has taken responsibility for putting that name forward. eos"
"sos only two people cling to the conspiracy theory, the prime minister and daniel jean. eos sos which one will appear before the public safety committee? eos","sos mr. speaker, the implications of the hon. eos sos gentleman's question in relation to daniel jean are truly unfortunate. eos"
"sos members of parliament deserve the same access to the national security adviser that the prime minister granted to the media. eos sos if the prime minister can send daniel jean to brief the media, why does he refuse to be transparent and not allow him to brief the democratically elected members of this house? eos","sos mr. speaker, when we read the motion that is before the house today, it focuses upon the invitation that was issued with respect to mr. atwal. eos sos in fact, the facts with respect to that invitation are abundantly clear. eos"
sos canadians want to know which one is true. eos sos mr. jean must come to explain this himself. eos,"sos mr. speaker, i think the hon. eos sos gentleman is misreading his own motion. eos"
"sos forget the motion, mr. minister. eos sos we want to know eos",sos order. eos sos the hon. eos
"sos the reporters got to hear what he had to say, but the members are not allowed to. eos sos why is that? eos","sos mr. speaker, the national security adviser is a public servant of long service to this country. eos sos he is a person who has served canada, always, with honour and distinction. eos"
"sos today, we learn that not only has the promised funding not materialized, but the number of tax evasion cases being investigated by the canada revenue agency has dropped from 167 to just 75 over the past six years. eos sos how can she keep saying that fighting tax evasion is a priority when she refuses to invest the funding that she promised and the number of cases under investigation is dropping? eos","sos mr. speaker, my colleague's rhetoric does not match reality. eos sos i invite him to reread the last three budgets. eos"
"sos we do not know who works on that committee, what it works on, or if it is accountable to anyone, yet we know this committee will shape canadian tax policy for years to come. eos sos how can the canada revenue agency expect to be trusted when everything it does is done behind closed doors? eos","sos mr. speaker, i would invite my colleague to try again. eos sos the general anti-avoidance rule committee provides advice on how to enforce the legislation. eos"
"sos one of them was the liberal research bureau's director, and the other brett thalmann, now the director of special projects in the prime minister's office. eos sos could the minister explain this continuing relationship with mr. wylie at the highest levels of the pmo? eos","sos mr. speaker, the lrb was clear and transparent in issuing the work statement yesterday, making it very clear that no information on canadians was in any way compromised. eos sos participating in conferences is not a new thing for political staffers. eos"
"sos one is measured by those with whom one associates. eos sos could the minister explain to the house whether the mining of canadians' social media data, and the use of the results of such analysis to tilt future canadian election outcomes falls under mr. thalmann's responsibilities as the director of special projects for the prime minister? eos","sos mr. speaker, i am glad the hon. eos sos member brought up data mining, because hamish marshall, the conservative campaign director, is also president of his own data mining company torch. eos"
sos the use of public money for this purpose is no small matter. eos sos was this payback for the work he did on the prime minister's last election campaign? eos,"sos mr. speaker, hamish marshall, the conservative campaign director for the next election, was also president and chief operating officer of go nuclear in 2011, when it bragged of providing everything from the standard tools like websites and email blasts, and web videos to social media management and infiltration. eos sos how much infiltration did mr. marshall do on behalf of the leader of the official opposition to help him win the leadership? eos"
"sos now we learn that, in august2016, he worked with two senior specialists in the prime minister's office. eos sos for the benefit of canadians, could the prime minister explain the special relationship between christopher wylie and the liberal party's top officials? eos","sos mr. speaker, we used a very secret strategy to win the 2015 election, and i want to share this with him. eos sos we actually put canadians first. eos"
"sos the liberals claimed they never used what mr. wylie was offering, but they paid him $100,000 anyway. eos sos why? eos","sos mr. speaker, the conservatives used data strategy when they engaged in a $100,000 contract with agility pr solutions. eos sos they have not actually provided the public with the statement of work. eos"
"sos if he really did not do any work, why was he paid? eos sos was it payback for his help in the 2015 campaign? eos","sos mr. speaker, the contract commenced in january 2016. later that year, that pilot was completed, and the lrb did not renew it. eos sos in terms of facebook ads, in terms of using facebook, right now the ndp have four ads running on facebook, the liberal party has 25, and the conservatives have 247 ads on facebook, 240 of which are used to attack liberal mps. eos"
"sos auto workers, auto manufacturers, and canadians have real and fair concerns about their future. eos sos the minister claims he is canada's chief marketing officer, so why does he continue to ignore the very real fears of canada's second largest exporter? eos","sos mr. speaker, trade helps strengthen the middle class by attracting job-creating investment in canada, and expanding export opportunities for canadian businesses to large and fast-growing markets. eos sos with cptpp, canada will soon have preferential access to half a billion customers in the world's most dynamic and fast-growing market. eos"
"sos that information is private, important, and extremely sensitive. eos sos what is the government going to do about this ineptitude? eos","sos mr. speaker, the cra takes the protection of canadians' tax information very seriously because the trust of individuals and businesses is the cornerstone of canada's tax system. eos sos the vast majority of breaches reported were the result of misdirected mail. eos"
sos either people trust the government or they do not. eos sos what will the minister do instead of blaming canada post? eos,"sos mr. speaker, had my colleague opposite listened carefully to my answer, he would know that i did not blame canada post. eos sos what i said was that the agency takes the protection of canadians' tax information very seriously because the trust of individuals is the cornerstone of canada's tax system. eos"
"sos in other words, the liberals are going to collect gst on the carbon tax that canadians are forced to pay. eos sos why is the environment minister breaking her word and taxing the tax? eos","sos mr. speaker, i always love getting up to answer the questions regarding putting a price on pollution from the opposition members. eos sos i am glad that the hon. eos"
sos it's a tax on a tax. eos,sos order. eos sos the hon. eos
sos this is among the most regressive taxes disproportionately targeting poor and working class people. eos sos why is the government taking from those with the least and putting a tax on a tax? eos,"sos mr. speaker, let us be clear. eos sos the most regressive thing one can do is do nothing on climate change. eos"
"sos canada post misplaced passports, revenue canada lost personal information, and the cse lost confidential information. eos sos when will the liberals take real action to protect canadians' privacy? eos","sos mr. speaker, as i have said, the agency takes the protection of canadians' tax information very seriously because the trust of individuals and businesses is the cornerstone of canada's tax system. eos sos the vast majority of breaches reported were the result of misdirected mail. eos"
"sos the public safety minister shared sentiments about officers and first responders, with which we all agree, but he did not actually answer my clear question, so i am asking it again. eos sos when will the prime minister himself condemn the physical violence against rcmp officers by illegal protesters of the trans mountain pipeline expansion? eos","sos mr. speaker, of course all canadians have the democratic right to express their point of view and to express dissent, but that must always be done within the parameters of the law. eos sos violence in those circumstances is simply unacceptable. eos"
"sos what canadians need is less rhetoric and more leadership in order to enforce the rule of law, to stop endangering the police, stop endangering the pipeline workers, and stop undermining canada's economy. eos sos will the prime minister finally do his job and condemn these illegal acts? eos","sos mr. speaker, with the hubbub in the house, i think the hon. eos sos gentleman missed my previous answer. eos"
"sos after yesterday's talk about the ridiculous memo on the use of mr. and mrs. , we now learn from ipolitics that farmers will be treated like criminals by service canada through a new guideline that gives inspectors an inordinate amount of power. eos sos why is the liberal prime minister coming down so hard on canadian farmers? eos","sos mr. speaker, my colleague touched on so many topics, i do not know where to begin. eos sos as far as farmers are concerned, we want western canadian grain to get to where it is going as quickly as possible. eos"
sos this is an unbelievable attack on canadian agriculture. eos sos why is the prime minister allowing farmers' property rights to be violated? eos,"sos mr. speaker, we are very proud of the work of the inspectors who work with service canada and follow all rules and regulations in doing this critical work. eos sos last year we assured canadians that when we use labour from other countries, we would protect those folks, that we we would make sure employers were living up to their obligations of taking care of the very people who are working so hard on behalf of canadians, and that is exactly what we are doing. eos"
"sos the minister's former colleague and former liberal mp, todd russell, is also getting in on the action. eos sos how long has the minister known that todd russel is involved? eos","sos mr. speaker, my colleague again makes a series of assertions based on a proposal that he has not seen. eos sos he should be very careful before he asserts a series of things that perhaps are entirely false. eos"
"sos is it the media? eos sos is it the liberal fisheries minister in newfoundland, the innu first nation, the qalipu first nation, the mi'kmaq first nation, or is it this minister? eos","sos mr. speaker, i can assure you and all members of the house that it certainly is not me who would spread misinformation. eos sos what i can tell the house is that our decision to include indigenous participation in this important offshore fishery was a historic decision. eos"
"sos i am no pescatarian, but something is fishy here. eos sos maritime politicians, the mi'kmaq first nation, and many others are asking if this is just a kickback for liberal party donors. eos","sos mr. speaker, what is fishy is colleagues standing up in the house of commons and asserting a series of things that are not accurate. eos sos what we said is that we would have a public process to encourage industry and indigenous groups to submit proposals of how they could access this important fishery, something that the previous conservative government did in 2014-15, but it forgot to include indigenous peoples. eos"
"sos insurgent ambushes, roadside bombs, and terrorist attacks on un bases are the norm in mali. eos sos will the prime minister honestly say what the united nations is saying and admit he is sending our troops into a war zone in mali. eos","sos mr. speaker, the safety of our brave women and men in uniform is extremely important to us, and we are doing everything we can to ensure they can do their work as safely as possible. eos sos however, let me be frank. eos"
"sos it is time for the senate to fix the liberal government's botched job and remove the section on grain transportation from bill c-49. eos sos [english]
